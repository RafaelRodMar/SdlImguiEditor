Menu bar : file, edit, build, views, settings, tools, help.<br>

Tools: hierarchy/project, level, layers, objects, log/console,
inspector.<br>

Resources: sprites, animation, mesh, sound, music, fonts.<br>

Map editor. Add and manipulate sprites on the scene. Save in JSON
format.<br>

Atlas: texture + text file describing the sprites in the texture.
(format: id + x,y,w,h)<br>

Sprites preview and manipulation: add/remove from canvas, select sprite
one by one, move sprites with mouse, rotate and scale.<br>

Working directory and saving: one directory for each scene with all the
related things there. JSON format allows easy loading.<br>

Layers: add/delete, move up/down, show/hide, move entire layer
horizontally/vertically. each layer is in a different JSON file, each
layer is a vector of sprites.<br>

Sprite manipulations: copy selected sprite to left, right, up, down,
diagonal. Useful for tilemap scene. Flip horizontally/vertically,
delete sprite, change color.<br>

Canvas : change color, shows position of the mouse.<br>

Log: describes what's happening and is saved with all the project files. engine_log("message")<br>

Auto Save: every 30 seconds.<br>

Mesh editor: objects made with connected points.<br>

Object Node (Entity): everything in a scene will be encapsulated in a
ObjectNode and attached to a parent.<br>

Different objects: <br>

primary objects: SpriteObject, LayerObject, MeshObject, PhysicObject,
AnimationObject, LightObject, SoundObject, MusicObject, ParticleObject,
ShaderObject.<br>

Logical objecs: combining two primary objects. MeshedObject( MeshObject
attached to SpriteObject), SolidObject (SpriteObject to a PhysicObject).<br>

Layers: objects are stored in layers and each layer only contains that
kind of object. The engine can create layers to separate different kind
of objects.<br>

Mesh, Mesh Object and Mesh Editor: <br>

Engine modes and submodes : <br>

- Scene edition mode: allows to build a scene. Submodes: <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - object: allows to handle any type of object.
Actions: add, delete, move, rotate, scale, duplicate.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - mesh: allows the edition of mesh objects in the
scene.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - play: allows to test the game in real time.<br>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong></strong></span>Mesh:
there are four types: polygon, circle, line, chain. A line is made of
two vertex, adding one more converts it into a chain.<br>

MeshObject: encapsulates a mesh.<br>

MeshEditor: mesh submode activates the meshEditor. User can :
add/remove/move vertex, move edge, edge extrusion.<br>
Solid Object: adding a sprite and a mesh you get a MeshedObject. The
mesh can be dynamic, static or kinematic. In play mode the engine
generates the physic object from the mesh.<br>
Name of entities: to retrieve them. Object o = engine.findObject("name")<br>
Categories of entities: for collision logic. can_collide(Player, Enemy)<br>
Grid.<br>
Gravity.<br>
Undo and redo actions.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong></strong></span> <strong>The Left</strong> : The left side of the Canvas :
Engine Mode, Save, Load, Sprite Tab, Mesh Tab, Color Tab<br>

four methods: begin, end, presolve and postsolve. Begin and end are
called when there is the first contact and when the contact ends. The
other are called arternatively and repeatedly while the objects are
overlapping.<br>
Actions: ActionObject, register actions in objects:
my_player.registerAction&lt;JumpAction&gt;("jump") ---&gt;&nbsp; if(key
j is pressed) m_player.callAction("jump").<br>
Objects in the hierarchy: find, move, remove.<br>
Collisions: cancollide("obj1", "ojb2")<br><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"></span>Configuration
files: JSON file with resources: name of the type of resource (font,
sound, music, texture, etc), folder, extension, default.<br>
Animations: the editor read the textures and the json files. It build automatically the animations.<br>
Animations has a name (player) and one or more sequences (idle, walk,
run, jump). The default sequence for player is idle, so idle can be
substituted by player for easyness.<br>
Sequences tab: its empty until you select an animation. Then it's
filled with the sequences, and each one contains: loop or not, frame
rate.<br>
Animations can be static telling them to not update and changing their
frame when necessary. A breakable object can show the frame 0 until it
breaks, then you set it to use the frame 1.<br>
Layers of the same type can be merged.<br>
Text object: it can be moved, rotated, scaled, duplicated..., you can
change its font, size, outline thickness, style(bold, italic,
underline, linethrough), color. For newline can be used the | character.<br>
Project manager: when the engine starts.<br>
