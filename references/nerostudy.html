Nero game engine is based on box2d Testbed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1920px; height: 1040px;" alt="" src="github_readme_engine_v2.png"><br>
<br>
The engine has two parts: the render engine and the dev engine.<br>
<br>
The render engine takes a scene and renders it. It offers the
possibility of resetting &nbsp;or pausing the scene.<br>
The dev engine offers:<br>
- automatic drawing, the necessary entities are created with a click.<br>
- move objects with mouse.<br>
- see object center of mass, bounding rectangle, etc.<br>
- see statitstics.<br>
<br>
The default scene nero::scene or nero::devscene has camera and input
functions.<br>
<br>
Also, i'm already working in some new features.&nbsp; the step 2 in
building my engine is the map editor. It will be possible to load
sprites and map them on the physic scene build with Box2D. I'll present
those new features by the end of this month, so, stay tuned <br>
<br>
I've added the possibility to add and manipulate sprites on the Scene.
And when all it's done, the physics (Box2D stuff) and the graphics
(sprites) can be saved separately in two files in a JSON format. Before
I explain, here is a video<br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/segLJa93ujs?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe><br>
<br>
Now let's see the new features in more detail.<br>
<br>
Feature 1 : Texture loading and sprite recognition<br>
For each texture, we need a ".txt" file with the same name. The ".txt"
file describes all the sprites we want to extract from that texture. <br>
the format of the ".txt" file is " Sprite_Id - BoundRect_Left -
BoundRect_Top - BoundRect_Width - BoundRect_Height ". After that, the
Engine just needs the path to the folder where textures are located.<br>

<br>
Feature 2 : Sprite preview<br>
When textures have been loaded and sprites detected, The engine offers
a preview of each sprite. During the preview, it's possible to zoom in
and out.<br>
<br>
Feature 3 : Sprite manipulation<br>
Here are manipulations we can apply on sprites, there will be more
later!<br>
&nbsp;- add/remove sprite in/from the canvas<br>
&nbsp;- select sprite one by one<br>
&nbsp;- move sprites with the mouse<br>
&nbsp;- rotate and scale sprites<br>
<br>
Feature 4 : Working directory and saving<br>
When several scenes are added to the Dev_Engine, the engine creates a
directory for each scene. The physics and the graphics are saved in the
directory of each scene. This allows us to work on several scenes at
the same time.<br>
Physics and Graphics are in JSON format and can be easily loaded in a
Nero Render_Engine.<br>
<br>
That's all for now,&nbsp; if anyone has feedback, please let me
know, your critics will help to improve the engine<br>
<br>
Hi everyone !, I'm back, let me present you <strong>Nero Game
Engine 0.3.0 </strong><br>
<br>
I've added many new features, the most important are Sprite_Layers and
some news Sprites Manipulations<br>
Here is a video <br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7msdIuvBmA?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe><br>
<br>
The new features are presented below, but I want to say now what I'm
going to do for the next.<br>
I will work mostly on Box2d, I first thought to build a Box2d editor,
but I think it will build a scripting system instead. Box2d stuff will
be described in a Lua script and the engine will build every using the
script.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1f/c5/d9/1fc5d9db27b98caebcc087d4f882660f.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img resized" style="cursor: pointer;" width="740"><br>
<br>
Now let's see the new features in more detail.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sprite_Layers</strong><br>
there are now layers in the engine with some classic functions<br>
&nbsp;- add/delete layer<br>
&nbsp;- move layer up/down<br>
&nbsp;- show/hide layer<br>
&nbsp;- change the color of all sprites in a layer<br>
&nbsp;- move the entire layer horizontally/vertically<br>
&nbsp;- each layer is saved in a different JSON file and can be
recovered as a std::vector&lt;sf::sprite&gt;<br>
the system I've built allows to add an infinite number of layer, but
I've restricted the number to 10, I think it's enough, and there is
always at least one layer<br>
<br>
<strong>Sprite Manipulations</strong><br>
there are new sprite manipulations that allow to build scenes quickly
and with intuitiveness<br>
&nbsp;- copy a selected sprite (the copy can be made in any
direction : left, right, up, down, diagonal), it useful for tilemap
scene<br>
&nbsp;- precision move (move sprite pixel by pixel, more accurate
than using the mouse)<br>
&nbsp;- change color<br>
&nbsp;- flip horizontally/vertically<br>
&nbsp;- delete by mouse click<br>
<br>
<strong>Canvas Color</strong><br>
the canvas color can be changed using some pre-configure buttons or the
RGB system<br>
<br>
<strong>Log</strong><br>
there is now a log that describes what's happening, the log is saved in
a .txt file at the same time than graphics and physics<br>
<br>
<strong>Auto_Save</strong><br>
the auto-saving saves everything every 30 seconds, I don't know if it's
a good interval of time.<br>
<br>
<strong>Load</strong><br>
to load something, the files just need to be in the working directory
of the Scene.&nbsp; When Engine the startup, it tries to load
Layers(graphics) and physics. So it's possible to begin a work, save
it, close the engine and come back to continue<br>
<br>
I think it's all, the last thing to remark is that the mouse position
on the canvas and in the world appears on top on the Canvas.<br>
<br>
The most interresting new feature is the <strong>Mesh Editor</strong>,
the engine let you edit Physical Object in a flexible way.<br>
<br>
I will talk more about that later, you can look at the video bellow to
get an idea<br>
<br>

<br>
Thanks for the comment but also for the SFGUI library. When i started
the project i asked myself, should i use QT or SFGUI, i wanted an
engine that is simple and that focus on the essential, i think SFGUI
suits the best to that philosophy. The library is great, i've used it
on two others projects, one call <strong>MyFinances</strong>
which is not related to game and another one called <strong>TheGame</strong>,
i will show case them one day.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Engine
Update</strong></span><br>
<br>
<strong>Object Node</strong><br>
I've implemented a Tree structure to hold all objects in a given scene.
When i started the engine i was handling only Sprites, things were
simple, each Layer of Sprites was represented by a std::vector. Now
that the number of different objects begin to increase, i need a more
flexible data structure. Starting from now everything in a scene will
be encapsulated in a ObjectNode and attached to a parent.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Different Objects</strong><br>
There are two main categories of objects, primary objects, and logical
objects<br>
<br>
Primary objects are represented by a Class in the engine. By exemple
for Sprites, there is a Class called SpriteObject that encapsulate a
sf::sprite.<br>
List of primary objects : LayerObject, SpriteObject, MeshObject,
PhysicObject (encapsulate a Box2d body)<br>
<br>
Logical objects are built by combining two or more primary objects.
Even if the engine recognize them, there are not explicit Classes that
represent them.<br>
List of logical objects : MeshedObject(a MeshObject attached to a
Spriteobject), SolidObject (a SpriteObject attached to a PhysicObject)<br>
<br>
I plan to make the concept of logical object a key concept of the
engine. Complex objects like a Player could be build using that concept.<br>
Also in the future (not for the first release), there will be more
primary objects like : AnimationObject, LightObject, SoundObject,
MusicOject, ParticleObject, ShaderObject etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Smart Layers</strong><br>
Now that each scene is based on a Tree structure, looking for a object
could be more complex. To reduce the time of processing over the tree,
objects are stored in Layers and each Layer always contain the same
type of object. Also the engine can create automatically some Layers in
order to prevent mixing different types of objects in the same layer.<br>
<br>
<strong>Video Time </strong><br>
The video present three types of objects : SpriteObject, MeshObject and
MeshedObject<br>
We can see that the engine automatically create layers. Also each layer
has a Color that indicate the type of object it is holding.<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>Next Time</strong><br>
The next time i'll talk in detail about Mesh Objects and the Mesh Editor<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Mesh,
Mesh Object and Mesh Editor</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi! everyone, how are you doing. Let's talk about Meshes this time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Engine Modes and SubModes</strong></span><br>
<br>
Before talking about Meshes, it would be helpfull to talk about the
Engine Modes and SubModes.<br>
The Engine has been built to work in several Modes. Currently the
Engine has only one Mode, the <strong>Scene Edition Mode</strong>.
This mode allows to build a scene.<br>
Each Mode has several SubModes. Our <strong>Scene Edition Mode</strong>
has three SubModes : Object, Mesh, Play.<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>Object SubMode</strong> : This SubMode
allows to handle any type of Object. The following actions can be
perform : Add, Delete, Move, Rotate, Scale, Duplicate (copy the Object
in any direction)</li>
<li><strong>Mesh SubMode</strong> : This SubMode
allows the edition of any Mesh present in the Scene.</li>
<li><strong>Play SubMode</strong> : This SubMode
allows to test the game in real time.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>A
Box2d Editor or a Mesh Editor ?</strong></span><br>
<br>
My first idea was to build a Box2d Editor. The Nero Game Engine, is
built with the idea to be <strong>Simple</strong>, <strong>Intuitive
</strong>and <strong>Efficient</strong>. I did not
want users to struggle with Box2d stuff. So, a Box2d Editor was the
perfect solution. But let's say thing clearly, build a Box2d Editor is
realy tough, months ago i would just say, it's impossible.<br>
When you create a Box2d Body, you can't modify it later, more, it's
difficult to store the Box2d Body somewhere in order to play with it
later because its constructor is private. It was the first time i've
seen a private constructor. <br>
With all those difficulties, i've just given up and begin to think to
alternative solutions.<br>
<br>
But, But, one day i woke up, and the solution came to my mind&nbsp;
<br>
I've forgotten the Idea to build a Box2d Editor and decided to build a
Mesh Editor instead. (I've stolen the name "<strong>Mesh</strong>"
from Blender&nbsp; )<br>
The Idea is that i don't need to Edit Box2d Body, instead, i can create
Meshes and then generate Box2d Bodies from those Meshes. Meshes are
pure SFML and C++, they don't contain any Box2d stuff, and the cool
thing, it's that they are really, really simple to Edit.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Mesh</strong></span><br>
<br>
Meshes are just a powerfull tool. There are four types of Mesh<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>Polygon</li>
<li>Circle</li>
<li>Line</li>
<li>Chain</li>
</ul>
The four types of Meshes are handled by the same Class. This allows to
switch from one type to another very easly. By example, a <strong>Line</strong>
is made of two vertex (vertices), when you add one more vertex, the
Mesh become automatically a <strong>Chain</strong>, and
when you remove that vertex you come back to a <strong>Line</strong>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>MeshObject</strong></span><br>
<br>
A MeshObject encapsulates a Mesh. When a user is in the <strong>Engine
Object SubMode</strong>, he can handle the MeshObject, this
SubMode does not allow to fully edit the Mesh.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>MeshEditor</strong></span><br>
<br>
When a user switches to the <strong>Engine Mesh SubMode</strong>,
there comes the magic. Going in that mode, activate the MeshEditor and
the user can now get access directly to the Meshes encapsulated in
MeshObjects. In that mode the following actions can be perform<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>Add vertex</li>
<li>Remove vetex</li>
<li>Move vertex</li>
<li>Move Edge</li>
<li>Edge Extrusion</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Next
Time</strong></span><br>
I will post a Cool Video in the next hours&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" class="smiley"><br>
The video will show the outcome of my work and the power of the Nero
Game Engine.<br>
<br>
<div class="post">
<div class="inner" id="msg_157325"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Nero
Game Engine 0.5 / Enjoy Box2D Physics !</strong></span><br>
<br>
For this post, i'm not going to talk alot, just checkout the following
video. I'm sure that many people who wish to make games with SFML and
Box2D have dream of something like that.<br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPGP1OmZ19w?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe></div>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Solid
Object</strong></span><br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.pinimg.com/564x/20/d2/5c/20d25c0b679614b2082e72371e1f580b.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img"><br>
<br>
As you may saw in the previous video, it's easy to add physics to
sprites or more exactly to create <strong>Solid Objects</strong>.
The following picture shows the process.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.pinimg.com/564x/55/98/93/559893d2ec7922878adbe176083378bf.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img"><br>
<br>
Things begin in the <strong>Engine Object Mode</strong>.
First add a sprite, then select the sprite and add a Mesh. Et voila !
you just created a <strong>Meshed Object</strong>. The
Mesh can take any Type (dynamic, static, kinematic) and any Shape
(line, chain, polygon, circle).<br>
<br>
By cliking on the Play button, the Engine goes to the <strong>Play
Mode</strong>, it generates a Physic Object from the Mesh and
attaches the previous sprite to it, what give us a <strong>Solid
Object</strong>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Physic
Object</strong></span><br>
<br>
When you simply add a MeshObject (without selecting a sprite), the
MeshObject becomes a simple Physic Object. This is good to create
grounds, delimit areas or build the scene base shape. here is a resume
of all objects.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/4d/f7/ef/4df7ef35700e87651207b230fe280814.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>A
Versatile Engine</strong></span><br>
<br>
The way the Engine as been built, allows it to create any type of 2d
games. When i've started the project, i've specified that i will focus
on platformers, but even if you don't want to use Box2d physics or make
platformers, The engine will suit to you as well. The Engine may be
used to create RPGs, Top Down games, or Puzzle games like TicTacToe. We
may notice three types of users.<br>
<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>Users 1 : I want to use all Box2d features</strong><br>
<br>
That is the default behavior of the engine, you can use Bodies,
Fixtures, Joints, Collisions, everything from Box2D<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Users 2 : I don't want to use Box2d at all</strong><br>
<br>
You just have to destroy all Box2d Bodies and Joints and then nullify
the b2_world (m_World = nullptr). Of corse you won't have to do it
yourself, i will add a Macro to handle that.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Users 3 : I want to use Box2D collisions but,
I don't want Box2D Physics simulation</strong><br>
<br>
You just have to make all Bodies as sensors, by doing that you will
have a functionnal collision system without any physics simulation. I
will add a box you can check somewhere, so all bodies will be
automatically in sensor mode.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>What
next for the Nero Game Engine ? </strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi! Everyone how are you doing&nbsp; <br>
<br>
It's almost one year that I&#8217;ve started the project. I've got into the
habit of making a post only when I actually make some progresses in the
development. I know, that, in this way it's difficult for you to
understand where I am going with the Engine. So in this post I will
describe the work that need to be done in order to complete the Project.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
First Release </strong></span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
The first release will be the version 0.6.x, the Engine will be
released as a precompiled library/API and games will be developed in C++<br>
In order to make this release many tasks need to be done.<br>
<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Task
1: Rebuild the "Saving and Loading" feature </strong></span><br>
<br>
When I&#8217;ve implemented the Object&#8217;s Tree data structure, I&#8217;ve completely
modified the engine heart. By doing that I&#8217;ve destroyed totally or
partially some features like: the way things are added or removed in
the canvas, the way things get selected, the way the layers work, etc.
I've already re-implemented most of those features. The remaining one
is the way Scenes are Saved and Loaded.<br>
Good news, I&#8217;ve already solved that in Pseudo code, I just need to make
the implementation.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Task
2: Add a window that let edit Physic_Objects properties </strong></span><br>
<br>
As you may saw, the Engine use Meshes in order to generate
Physic_Objects. So all Physic_Objects properties are carried by Meshes.
Currently only the type (Dynamic, Kinematic, Static) of the mesh can be
choosed. But for those you know Box2D, Box2D bodies are made of one
Body (b2Body) and somes Fixtures (b2Fixture). Bodies and Fixtures have
properties like density, velocity, fix rotation etc. that can be
customized. So there will be a window to handle that.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Task
3: Add a way to give a "Name" and a "Category" to each Object </strong></span><br>
<br>
The <strong>Name</strong> of a object will be the
primarily way to retrieve it in the code. In the code it'll be possible
to write something like: <strong>Object o =
engine.findObject(&#8220;ojbect_name&#8221;)</strong><br>
<br>
The Object <strong>Categories</strong> will serve
primarily to build the game collision logic. In simple word you will be
able to specify which category of object can collide with which other
category. In the code it'll be possible to write something like:<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>can_collide (Player, Enemy);</strong></li>
<li><strong>can_collide (Player_Bullet, Enemy);</strong></li>
<li><strong>can_collide (Player, Enemy_Bullet);</strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
Internally the engine will configure Box2D Collision <strong>Filtering
</strong> for you.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Task
4: Process Box2D Collisions </strong></span><br>
<br>
Build a game will consist mainly to retrieve collisions and give
response to them. Box2D gives four functions to handle collisions:
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>BeginContact(b2Contact* contact)</strong></li>
<li><strong>EndContact(b2Contact* contact)</strong></li>
<li><strong>PreSolve(b2Contact* contact, const
b2Manifold* oldManifold)</strong></li>
<li><strong>PostSolve(b2Contact* contact, const
b2ContactImpulse* impulse)</strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
As I don't want users to struggle with Box2D stuff (It really gives
some headaches), the Engine will process collisions for you in order to
simplify things. For each of those four functions you'll be able write
something like<br>
<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>nero::Collision c =
engine.process(b2Contact)</strong> or</li>
<li><strong>nero::Collision c =
engine.process(b2Contact, b2Manifold) </strong>or</li>
<li><strong>nero::Collision c =
engine.process(b2Contact, b2ContactImpulse</strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
That way you will only have to deal with nero::Collision, the
nero::Collision will give you the two nero::Object that are colliding
and all other information concerning the collision.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Task
5: Build a game prototype </strong></span><br>
<br>
To ensure that the Engine is ready for a first release I will build a
game prototype. The prototype will be entirely made with physics, that
means no graphics (Sprite), no sound, no music. The goal will be to
have a fluid game.<br>
<br>
It&#8217;ll be a platformer, the Player will be a simple Cube or Circle that
can move right/left, jump, double jump and dash.<br>
<br>
This prototype will be used to test the engine fluidity but also its
limits.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Second Release </strong></span><br>
<br>
After the first release, we will have an Engine that work fine, with
most bugs fixed. Now in order to show the power and the potential of
the Engine I will build a small adventure game (only one scene) with
high quality graphics. In this game, Box2D physics will be completely
transparent and the following features will be added<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>Animation Object </strong></li>
<li><strong>Sound Object </strong></li>
<li><strong>Music Object </strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
When this game will be completed the Engine will be ready for a second
release (The Official one with a full tutorial). And again the engine
will be release as a precompiled library/API and games will be
developed in C++<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Third Release </strong></span><br>
<br>
The third release will concern the version 0.7.x to 1.0.0<br>
<br>
In those versions Lua will be added as a scripting language, therefore
the default language to build games with the Nero Game Engine will be
Lua. And the Engine will no longer be a Library/API, You will be able
to install the engine as any other software on Windows, Linux and MacOS
and start build games in your prefer IDE (Notepad++, Sublime etc).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
End </strong></span><br>
<br>
After adding Lua as a scripting language, my work will be completed. Of
course I&#8217;ll continue to maintain the Engine and fix bugs but I will no
longer add some features.<br>
<br>
But, you should know that many features could still be added to the
Engine, features like Particle Object, Soft Light Object, Shader
Object, Artificial Intelligence etc. Also ones could think to carry the
Engine on QT in order to benefit from more advance feature like color
wheel, MVC structure, file management etc.<br>
<br>
The Engine will be open source, so if any one wish to add features to
the Engine it'll be up to him, also I know there are others great
projects on this forum, those projects could be combined with the Nero
project in order to build a real big and robust framework for SFML
users.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's all for this post, have a good day&nbsp; <br>

Hi! everyone, in a&nbsp; previous post, i've said that i will be
busy on the next days, so i'll need to slow down the development, but
guess what, i suddenly get some days off! what allows me to make a
great progress on the Engine. Therefore i'm pretty happy now&nbsp; . Instead
of making a post on the new features or make a video, i've thought, it
would be better if you can try the engine yourself.<br>

<li>Load</li>
<li>Grid</li>
<li>Gravity (Grav X, Grav Y)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Break
the Engine , Report bugs</strong></span><br>
<br>
Currently the Engine doen't defines limits, the canvas is infinite, the
number of objects that can be added is infinite, the number of vertex
in a line or polygon is infinite, objects can be zoom down or up at
infinite etc.<br>
<br>
So you are free to play as you want. I encourage you to try to break
the engine in any you could think, and if you find bugs just report it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Resources</strong></span><br>
<br>
The resources used in the download has been grabbed over the internet,
i've no right on them, but they are mostly free resources.<br>
<br>
You can use the Textures you want, just copy them in the <strong>/Resource/Texture</strong>
folder.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to use the Engine</strong></span><br>
<br>
I will make some regular posts on how to use the Engine, and if you
have any question just ask, Those posts will be gathered later in order
to build the engine <strong>Tutorial Book</strong><br>
<br>
The Engine use the following Inputs<br>
<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>Mouse or TouchPad</li>
<li>The Numpad</li>
<li>CTRL, SHIFT, ALT&nbsp; : in combinaison with the Mouse,

Game Engine Happy Release 2.0</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone, how do you do!<br>
<br>
Before to begin with the <strong>Engine Howtos</strong>,
i've taken the time to add the following features to the Engine.<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>Save and Load Scenes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Auto Save Scenes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Undo and Redo Actions</strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
I'll present those features briefly, the details will be for another
post<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Save
and Load Scenes</strong></span><br>
<br>
Each Scene is saved in a single JSON file locate at <strong>NERO/scene_name/scene_name.json</strong><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Auto
Save Scenes</strong></span><br>
<br>
The <strong>Auto Save</strong> feature is based on the <strong>Save
and Load</strong> feature, when Auto Save is activate, the scene
is saved each <strong>30 seconds</strong><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Undo
and Redo Actions</strong></span><br>
<br>
This feature is an unexpected one.&nbsp; I did not plan it since
the beginning of the Project. But when, i've completed the <strong>Save
and Load</strong> feature, I realised that I could use it to
build a <strong>Undo Redo System</strong>.<br>
<br>
Currently there no limit on the number of Undo-Redo.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to use the Engine 00 : The Nero Dev Engine !</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi guys ! Are you ready for the Nero Game Engine Adventure ?.....?
Let's begin !<br>
<br>
This series of Howtos will show how to use the Nero Dev Engine. Since
the engine is not complete, those Howtos will cover only the available
features.<br>
<br>
You can download the Dev Engine in the beta version on the Post just
above this one!<br>
<br>
There is a little overview of those Howtos.<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>How to use the Engine 01 : Play with Objects !</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to use the Engine 02 : Control the Camera
!</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to use the Engine 03 : Let's Edit Meshes !</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to use the Engine 04 : Workflow !</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to use the Engine 05 : Use your own
Resources !</strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
Before we start, one more precision. The Dev Engine Interface can be
divided into Three Main Part :<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>The Left</strong> : The left side of the Canvas :
Engine Mode, Save, Load, Sprite Tab, Mesh Tab, Color Tab<br>
<strong>The Center</strong> : The Canvas, the utility
buttons on top the Canvas, the Log window bellow the Canvas<br>
<strong>The Right</strong> : The right side of the Canvas :
Layer, Mesh, Object, Scene, Draw Checkbuttons, etc.<br>
<br>
So if I say you can change the current Scene using the Select Button in
the Top Right of Engine you know where it is.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.pinimg.com/originals/1e/d2/10/1ed210e1ed0f508ffc324289e42096b6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img resized" style="cursor: pointer;" width="740"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to use the Engine 01 : Play with Objects !</strong></span><br>
<br>
Build a Game Scene consists to add Objects onto the Canvas and then
Customize them. There are three (3) types of Objects : <strong>Sprite_Object</strong>,
<strong>Mesh_Object</strong>, <strong>Meshed_Object</strong><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Add
Sprite Objects</strong></span><br>
<br>
In order to add a Sprite_Object, <strong>click on a Sprite_Button</strong>.
On the Left of the Engine, you have the Sprite_Tab. By passing the
Mouse over the a sprite button you can see a <strong>Sprite_Preview</strong>.
You can use the <strong>Numpad_Multiply</strong> and <strong>Numpad_Divide</strong>
buttons to scale the Sprite_Preview. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Add
Mesh Objects</strong></span><br>
<br>
In order to add a Mesh_Object, <strong>select a Mesh_Shape
(Polygon, Circle, Line)</strong>. On the Right of the Engine you
have the Mesh_Selection_Button.<br>
<br>
Mesh_Objects are created with a default Type. Polygons and Circles are
always created as Dynamic Mesh and Lines as Static Mesh.<br>
In order to change the Mesh type, select it and choose the Type you
want (Dynamic, Static, Kinematic).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Add
Meshed Objects</strong></span><br>
<br>
In order to add a Meshed_Object <strong>hold the CTRL key</strong>
and <strong>click on a Sprite Button</strong>, it's the
same way that to add a Sprite_Object but you need to hold the CTRL Key
befor.<br>
The default Mesh of a Meshed_Object is always a Dynamic Polygon Mesh.
To change that, select your Meshed_Object then choose the Mesh_Shape
and the Mesh_Type you want.<br>
<br>
A Meshed_Object is a combinaison of a Sprite_Object and a Mesh_Object,
so Actions that can be applied on one of the both, can be applied to
the Meshed_Object.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Select
Objects</strong></span><br>
<br>
When you make a Left_Click on an Object, you Briefly select it. As soon
as you release the Left_Click the Object get unselected.<br>
<br>
In order to make a Permanent Selection you have to make a <strong>Right_Click
on the Object</strong>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Remove
objects</strong></span><br>
<br>
You have two ways to delete an Object. The first one is to make a
Permanent Selection and then press the <strong>Delete Key</strong>.
The second one is to hold ALT and Left_Click on the Object.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Move,
Scale, Rotate&nbsp; Objects</strong></span><br>
<br>
You can Move, Scale, Rotate Objects with either the Numpad or Mouse. <br>
<br>
Mouse / <strong>Move</strong> : Left_Click on a Object.
Hold your click and move the mouse<br>
Mouse / <strong>Scale</strong> : Hold the CRTL key. Then
Left_Click on an Object. Hold your click and move the mouse Up or Down<br>
Mouse / <strong>Rotate</strong> : Hold the SHIFT key. Then
Left_Click on an Object. Hold your click and move the mouse Up or Down<br>
<br>
Using the <strong>Numpad</strong> you have to make a
Permanent Selection on the Object first and then <strong>Hold
the CTRL key</strong>.<br>
<br>
Numpad / <strong>Move</strong> : Numpad_4, Numpad_6,
Numpad_2, Numpad_8<br>
Numpad / <strong>Scale</strong> : Numpad_Addition,
Numpad_Substract<br>
Numpad / <strong>Rotate</strong> : Numpad_7, Numpad_9,
Numpad_Multiply, Numpad_Divide<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Flip
Objects</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Flipping concerns <strong>Sprite_Object</strong> or <strong>Meshed_Object</strong>.
When you apply it to Mesh_Object or even Meshed_Object you may
encounter some weird behaviours, that because, Meshes are not meant to
be flipped. But it's not a big deal, you just have to Edit your Mesh to
fix it. I'll correct the Flipping function for Meshes one day&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
In order to Flip an Object, first make a Permanent Selection and then
Hold the <strong>CTRL key</strong><br>
<br>
Numpad / <strong>Flip Horizontally</strong>: Numpad_1<br>
Numpad / <strong>Flip Vertically</strong> : Numpad_3<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Duplicate
Objects</strong></span><br>
<br>
This is great to make <strong>Tiled-Like Scenes</strong>.<br>
<br>
In order to Duplicate an Object, first make a Permanent Selection and
then Hold the <strong>ALT key</strong><br>
<br>
Duplicate Horizontally and Vertically &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
Numpad_4, Numpad_6, Numpad_2, Numpad_8<br>
Duplicate in Diagonal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : Numpad_1, Numpad_7, Numpad_9,
Numpad_3<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Layers</strong></span><br>
<br>
On the Right you can see the Stack of Layers. There are some buttons to
Add, Delete, Move UP and Move Down Layers.<br>
<br>
The See_Button allows to Hide or Show a Layer<br>
The Check_Button allows to Select a Layer<br>
<br>
When you add an Object, it goes to the <strong>Currently
Selected Layer</strong>. But Layers always contain the same Type
of Object. So if you add a Sprite_Object when your currently selected
Layer contains some Meshes, the Engine will create automatically a new
Layer before to add the Sprite_Object.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Move
an entire Layer</strong></span><br>
<br>
It is possible to move all Objects in a Layer. In order to achieve
that, first, make sure the Layer is selected, then <strong>Hold
CTRL and ALT</strong> and use the following keys: Numpad_4,
Numpad_6, Numpad_2, Numpad_8<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>That's
All!</strong></span><br>
<br>
That's all for the first Howto. Just bear in mind that you can play
with Objects either with the Mouse or with the Numpad. By default the
Numpad is used to handle the Camera, so in order to used it with
Objects you have combine it with CTRL or ALT. We'll talk about the
Camera in the next Howto.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to use the Engine 02 : Control the Camera !</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone !<br>
<br>
In the previous Howto, we saw how to add, remove, duplicate objects and
more! so let's play with the Camera this time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Scroll
the Camera</strong></span><br>
<br>
Using the <strong>Numpad</strong> you can scroll
horizontally and vertically the Camera using the following keys : <br>
<strong>Numpad_4, Numpad_6, Numpad_8, Numpad_2</strong><br>
<br>
Using the <strong>Mouse</strong> you can achieve the same
actions with <strong>CTRL + Mouse_Wheel</strong> for
scrolling vertically and<strong> ALT + Mouse_Wheel</strong>
for scrolling horizontally.<br>
<br>
If you use a <strong>Touch_Pad </strong>you don't have to
use <strong>ALT + Mouse_Wheel</strong>, you can scroll
horizontally directly.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Scale
the Camera</strong></span><br>
<br>
Using the <strong>Numpad</strong> you can scale the Camera
with the <strong>Numpad_Addition</strong> and <strong>Numpad_Substruct</strong>
keys.<br>
<br>
Using the <strong>Mouse</strong> you can scale the Camera
with the <strong>Mouse_Wheel</strong><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Rotate
the Camera</strong></span><br>
<br>
Using the <strong>Numpad</strong> you can rotate the
Camera with the <strong>Numpad_7</strong> and <strong>Numpad_9</strong>
keys<br>
<br>
Using the <strong>Mouse</strong> you can do the same with <strong>SHIFT
+ Mouse_Wheel</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Save
and Restore the Camera</strong></span><br>
<br>
I guess the actions above were pretty obvious, so what about this one.<br>
<br>
The Canvas is infinite, so you may lose yourself going here and there.
In order to avoid that you can register the current Camera state
(Position, Scale, Rotation) with <strong>ALT + Numpad_5</strong>.
Now you can go where you want and press the <strong>Numpad_5 </strong>
key to come back.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to use the Engine 03 : Play with Meshes !&nbsp; &nbsp;
|&nbsp; &nbsp; Part 1 : Mesh Edition !</strong></span><br>
<br>
Meshes are a key component of the Engine. I'm sure you'll like to play
with them.<br>
<br>
There are four types of Mesh. <strong>Polygon</strong>, <strong>Circle</strong>,
<strong>Line </strong>and <strong>Chain</strong>.
When you click on the Mesh_Selection button on the Right of the Engine,
you don't see <strong>"Chain"</strong> along with
"Polygon", "Circle" and "Line", that's normal because Chains are
created out of Lines.<br>
<br>
soooooooo Let's Begin !<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Switch
between the Object Mode and the Mesh Mode</strong></span><br>
<br>
You can switch easly between <strong>Object Mode</strong>
and <strong>Mesh Mode</strong> using the <strong>Space
bar</strong> key.<br>
<br>
If you want to get to the <strong>Play Mode</strong> you
have to do <strong>CTRL + Space bar</strong>, to come back
to Object Mode, just press Space bar again (we'll talk more about that
later).<br>
<br>
When you are in Object Mode, you are dealing with the <strong>Object_Manager</strong>
of the current Scene. By going in Mesh Mode, you are letting the<strong>
Mesh_Editor</strong> take control of the Canvas.<br>
<br>
The Mesh_Editor has access to all Meshes present in your Scene either
the mesh is encapsulated in a Mesh_Object or a Meshed_Object. It can
fully modified them but not delete them.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Move
Vertex</strong></span><br>
<br>
To move a Vertex, <strong>Left_Click</strong> on it, and
drag it where you want.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Move
Line</strong></span><br>
<br>
To move a Line, <strong>Left_Click</strong> on it, and
drag it where you want.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Add
Vertex</strong></span><br>
<br>
Vertice can be added on any Line. For that, make a <strong>Right_Click</strong>
where you want on a Line.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Remove
Vertex</strong></span><br>
<br>
A <strong>Right_Click</strong> on a Vertex will remove it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Drag
Mesh</strong></span><br>
<br>
You can <strong>Left_Click</strong> and drag easly a <strong>Polygon</strong>,
a <strong>Circle</strong> or a <strong>Line</strong>.
To move a <strong>Chain</strong> you have to select it
first (see below)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Select
Mesh</strong></span><br>
<br>
Use <strong>CTRL + Left_Click</strong> in order to select
any Mesh, it will become <strong>Orange</strong><br>
<br>
You can click any where else in the Canvas to make a deselection (In
the next release I will configure the <strong>Escape</strong>
key for deselection) <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Move,
Scale, Rotate Mesh</strong></span><br>
<br>
When a Mesh is selected you can Move, Scale or Rotate it the same way
you do with Sprite : <strong>CTRL + Numpad Keys</strong>.
The Mouse is not used here, it works only with the Numpad.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Extrude
Line</strong></span><br>
<br>
If you have ever used a 3D modeling software you know what Extrusion
means, if not you can Google it.<br>
<br>
In order to Extrude a Line you just have to hold the <strong>SHIFT
key</strong> then <strong>Left_Click</strong> and <strong>drag</strong>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Extrude
Vertex</strong></span><br>
<br>
Works same as for Lines. Hold the <strong>SHIFT key</strong>
then <strong>Left_Click</strong> on a Vertex and <strong>drag</strong>.<br>
<br>
<strong>It only works on Lines and Chains Edge Vertice Currently
!!!</strong>, I may consider extend that to others Vertice in the
next releases.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Flip
Mesh</strong></span><br>
<br>
I did not consider that feature even once since I've begun the Project.
I'll make that for <strong>Engine Second Release</strong>.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Mesh
Validation</strong></span><br>
<br>
Each time a Mesh is modified the Mesh_Editor checks for its validity.
When a Mesh it's not valid it becomes <strong>Red</strong><br>
<br>
A <strong>Red Mesh</strong> is not converted in Box2D Body
because the Box2D library raise <strong>Exceptions </strong>when
it can't generate a Body.<br>
<br>
The <strong>Mesh Validation System is currently incomplete !!!</strong>
You may encounter some crashes when you have <strong>at least
three Vertices almost aligned</strong>. The current solution is
to <strong>Save </strong>your Scene before hitting the <strong>Play_Button</strong>
or the <strong>Return Key</strong>.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>That's
All ! </strong></span><br>
<br>
So, that's all for this Howto. With the Mesh_Editor, you can create any
shape like Trees, Animals , Landscapes, the limit is your imagination. <br>
<br>
when you are done editing some Meshes, you can press the <strong>Space
bar key</strong> to return in Object Mode and then press the <strong>Return
key</strong> in order to see your Meshes come alive. On the
Bottom Right of the Engine you have some <strong>Check_Buttons</strong>
that allow you to hide or show divers information about Box2D Bodies.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to use the Engine 03 : Play with Meshes !&nbsp; &nbsp;
|&nbsp; &nbsp; Part 2 : Mesh and Meshed Object Properties !</strong></span>
<br>
<br>
Hi everyone, how are you doing !&nbsp; In this second Howto on
Meshes we'll talk about some Mesh properties.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Mesh
Object and Meshed Object</strong></span><br>
<br>
First of all, I hope that, both words are not confusing you, I don't
think that munch before to choose my Classes names, I just took the
first ones that come to my mind&nbsp; .<br>
<br>
There is a little reminder<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>Mesh Object = Mesh</li>
<li>Meshed Object = Mesh + Sprite</li>
</ul>
<br>
Both Objects carry a <strong>Mesh </strong>and that Mesh
can be configured to suit your needs.<br>
<br>
On the Left of the Engine, along with the <strong>Sprite Tab</strong>
and <strong>Color Tab</strong>, you get the <strong>Mesh
Tab</strong>, we gonna play with it. The properties below work
the same way on both Objects types, you just have to select them and
apply the one you want.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Fixed
Rotation</strong></span><br>
<br>
This one is pretty easy, when activated, your Object will never rotate
even if it stand on a sloping ground or if it get hit by a projectile.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Is
Sensor</strong></span><br>
<br>
This is one of the Coolest feature of Box2D. When talking about Box2D
the first thing people see is the "Physics Simulation" Part of the
library. But the thing is, if you set all your objects to Sensor mode,
you end up with a powerfull "Collision Detection Engine" without any
Physic Simulation. This let you free to implement your own Physic
Simulation.<br>
<br>
Object in Sensor Mode stay affected by Gravity, but that's all, they
don't participate to the "Physics Simulation". that's make them great
to build your game logic. You can use them to check if your Character
has reached a certain area and then trigger a specific event. When i'll
build my game prototype, i'll show how you can use Object in sensor
mode to do great things.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Allow
Sleep</strong></span><br>
<br>
This property is activated by default, and it should stay like that. It
will help reduce the computation operated by Box2D.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Density
| value : [0 - 100]</strong></span><br>
<br>
What is Density ? in simple words it's a short of relation between an
Object Volume and its Weight. For the same volume, the same Object will
get a higher weight if its Density get increased. In your game, that
will make your objects more stronger.<br>
<br>
To check that, create two identical Polygon Meshes, let's call them
Left_P and Right_P. Now using the mouse, take Left_P and throw it on
Right_P. Right_P will get ejected easly, now increase its density to
100 and throw Left_P on it again, you will see that now Right_P is more
resistant or stronger.<br>
<br>
Also the Density don't affect the way Gravity affect the Object. Two
Ojects with the same volume, and different density (e.g different
weight) will be affected the same way by the gravity (in the absence of
air resistance to be more accurate). Fo more detail on that go check
Newton Laws.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Friction
| value : [0 - 10]</strong></span><br>
<br>
What is Friction ? If you don't want your Object to slide on a sloping
ground just increase its Friction. If you want your Object to slide on
any surface like if it was ice set the Friction to 0.&nbsp; For
more technical explication you can Google <strong>Friction Force</strong><br>
<br>
Internally Box2D use a range value of [0 - 1], In order to avoid using
decimal, the Nero Engine use the range value of [0 - 10].<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Restitution
| value : [0 - 10]<strong></strong></strong></span><br>
<br>
What is Restitution ? Increase Restitution will allow your Object to
bounce more easly. For more technical explication you Google <strong>Coefficient
of restitution</strong><br>
<br>
Internally Box2D use a range value of [0 - 1], In order to avoid using
decimal, the Nero Engine use the range value of [0 - 10].<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Gravity
Scale | value : [0 - 10]</strong></span><br>
<br>
If you want to change the way your Objects are affected by gravity,
this is the property to configure. Set the value to 0 will allow your
Object to float on the air. Increase the value, will make your object
fall down more quickly.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Engine Physics Default settings</strong></span><br>
<br>
When using Box2D the first time, The first thing you notice, is that
the physics simulation is slow. According to my experience there are
three Settings to configure in order to fix that.<br>
<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>The <strong>Pixel / Meter Ratio</strong> used</li>
<li>The Box2D World <strong>Computation Freqency</strong></li>
<li>The Box2D Bodies<strong> Gravity Scale</strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
The Nero Engine use a <strong>Pixel / Meter Ratio of 30</strong>.
It means that <strong>30 pixel</strong> on your canvas
will be equivalent to <strong>1 meter</strong> for Box2D.
This value is hard coded in the Engine, I may consider make it
configurable in the next releases.<br>
<br>
The Default <strong>Computation Frequency is set to 30 Hertz</strong>,
you can see it on the Right of the Engine. Fill free to play with this
value.<br>
<br>
The Engine also use a default <strong>Gravity Scale of 3</strong>
for all Object. I've tried several values and comes up with this one,
it's the most important parameter between the three. the computation
Frequency coming in second position.<br>
<br>
By adding more and more Dynamic object onto the Canvas, the Physic
simulation may become slow, so, remenber to play with those Three
parameters in order get the Simulition Speed that suit you.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to use the Engine 04 : Workflow !</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi! again, not sure that the title is the right one, but we'll stick
with it. In this Howto we'll talk about some Util Actions that you may
used every time during the process of creating a game.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Select
Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Engine is able to menage several Scenes, each one having its own
directory under the <strong>NERO/ folder</strong>. On the
Right of the Engine you have a selection button that let you choose the
scene you are going to work on.<br>
<br>
You can also use <strong>Numpad_1</strong> and <strong>Numpad_3</strong>
to switch between the available Scenes.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>What
about Create Scenes ?</strong></span> <br>
<br>
I purposely avoid adding a button to create new Scenes. This will be
available when Lua will be added as a scripting language. The thing is
that, currently you have to access your Scene Class in order to build
your game logic.<br>
<br>
You create a new Scene by declaring a new Class and then adding it to
the Engine.<br>
<br>
<div class="quoteheader">
<div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div>
</div>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Class MyScene :
public nero:DevScene<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; //Retrieve all Objects you created with the Engine and Build
your game logic here<br>
}</blockquote>
<div class="quotefooter">
<div class="botslice_quote"></div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="quoteheader">
<div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div>
</div>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">nero:DevEngine
engine;<br>
engine.addScene&lt;MyScene&gt;("My Scene Name");<br>
engine.run();</blockquote>
<div class="quotefooter">
<div class="botslice_quote"></div>
</div>
<br>
You can add any number of Scenes, All the Scenes added will be
available on the Scene selection button.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Load
Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
When the Engine start, it tries to load all the scene that have been
added. For that it parses the NERO/ folder and check for your Scenes
JSON file. If the JSON file doesn't exist it mean that the Scene as
never been Saved and you end up with a empty Canvas.<br>
<br>
The <strong>Load_Button</strong> on the Right on the
Engine allows to load the content of your Scene JSON file at any time.<br>
<br>
Load a Scene with the Load_Button can be Undo or Redo like as any other
Action, so don't be afraid to lost your work, after accidently pressed
the Load_Button.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Save
Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
The <strong>Save_Button</strong> allows to save your Scene
at any time, this will overwrite your Scene JSON file.<br>
<br>
In the next releases I'll add the <strong>CTRL + S</strong>
shorcut to save the Scene.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Undo
Redo Actions</strong></span><br>
<br>
On top of the Canvas you have two buttons to <strong>Undo</strong>
and <strong>Redo</strong> your Actions. the <strong>|&lt;--|</strong>
button will Undo actions, and the <strong>|--&gt;|</strong>
will Redo Actions.<br>
<br>
You can also use the the <strong>Left_Arrow</strong> and <strong>Right_Arrow</strong>
keys to achieve the same thing.<br>
<br>
Undo and Redo actions work in the Engine <strong>Object_Mode</strong>
and <strong>Mesh_Mode</strong>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Play
Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
When your are done creating some Objects you can <strong>Generate</strong>
your Game Scene by pressing the <strong>Play_Button</strong>
locate on top of the Canvas.<br>
<br>
Using the keyboard you can also press the <strong>Return_Key</strong>.<br>
<br>
The <strong>CTRL + Spacebar</strong> allows to switch to <strong>Play_Mode</strong>
but it does not <strong>Generate</strong> the Game Scene
like the Play_Button<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Pause
Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
When in Play_Mode you can Pause the Scene using the <strong>Pause_Button</strong>
or the keyboard <strong>P key</strong> or the <strong>Left_Arrow
key</strong>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Step
Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
When in Play_Mode you can Step the Scene using the <strong>Step_Button</strong>
or the <strong>Right_Arrow key</strong>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Reset
Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
When in Play_Mode you can Reset the Scene using the <strong>Reset_Button</strong>
or the keyboard <strong>R key</strong> or the <strong>Up_Arrow
key</strong>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Quit
the Engine</strong></span><br>
<br>
The <strong>Quit_Button</strong> button allows to close
the Dev Engine. In the next releases I will configure it to Save all
Scenes before to close the Engine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to use the Engine 05 : Use your own Resources !</strong></span><br>
<br>
Ones may use the word <strong>Asset</strong>, other like
me may use the word <strong>Resource</strong>. So what is
it? Resources are <strong>Textures</strong>, <strong>Sounds</strong>,
<strong>Musics</strong>, <strong>Shaders</strong>
and <strong>Fonts</strong> you are going to use to build
your game. Manage Resources is an important point when building a game.
In order to simplify things, the Engine take care of every. Most of
time, if you need to use a resource, you'll just have to copy and paste
it in the right sub-directory under the <strong>Resource/ folder</strong>.<br>
<br>
The <strong>Name</strong> of your resource will be its <strong>Id</strong>
in the Engine, so for a given Category of Resources, you can't give the
same name to two different resources.<br>
<br>
When the engine start, it parses the <strong>Resource/ directory</strong>
and loads everything. If it founds a problem it throws an Exception and
don't start. So, if you get the Engine start without any trouble be
ensured that all resources have been loaded correctly.<br>
<br>
The Engine use the<strong> Sansation Font</strong> locate
at <strong>Resource/Font/Sansation.ttf</strong> for its
own Text rendering, This is the only resource that must be always
available, for others, you can delete them or replace them with what
you want.<br>
<br>
Retrieve Resources in the Code is pretty simple, there is some examples.<br>
<br>
<div class="quoteheader">
<div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div>
</div>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">auto myFont =
m_ResourceManager.Font.get("Font Name");<br>
auto myTexture = m_ResourceManager.Texture.getTexture("Texture Name");<br>
auto myTexture = m_ResourceManager.Texture.getSpriteTexture("Sprite
Name"); //Return the Texture that contains your Sprite<br>
auto mySound &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
m_ResourceManager.Sound.get("Sound Name");<br>
auto myMusic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
m_ResourceManager.Music.get("Music Name");<br>
auto myShader = m_ResourceManager.Shader.get("Shader Name");</blockquote>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>End
of this First Series of Howtos</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Series of Howtos comes to its end. It was pretty fun for me to
write them. I hope you have enjoyed reading them. I've tried to cover
most of the features that have been implemented until now. <br>
<br>
If you have been able to play with the Engine, I'll be happy to see
some screenshoots of the Scenes your have created.<br>
<br>
For the Next Step of the Projet, I'll use efficiently my free time in
order to Release the Engine as soon as possible.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Collision
Management | Part I : Collision Filtering</strong></span><br>
<br>
I guys, how are you doing&nbsp; . Today
we gonna talk about collision, let say you have a game and you want
certain objects to collide and others not, this post will show how easy
it is to achieve that with the Nero Game Engine.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
nero::CollisionRule Class</strong></span><br>
<br>
Box2D offers two ways to filter collisions, filter collisions just
means define which object can collide with which one. The first method
use <strong>Category_Bits</strong> and <strong>Mask_Bits</strong>,
the second use <strong>Goup_Indexs</strong>. Those are
Box2D Fixtures properties. I'm not going to describe those two
technics, the only thing to know it's the first one offers more
flexibility, but it is pretty difficult to implement. The
nero::CollisionRule Class use Category_Bits and Mask_Bits and it allows
you to filter collision in the easiest way you could think.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>In
Practice</strong></span><br>
<br>
Using the Dev_Engine Interface you can provide a Category to any
Object. Categories are represented by a String so you can write
whatever you want (I plan to use regex to limit thing, but that's not
for now). <br>
<br>
For instance let say we have the following categories : <strong>player</strong>,
<strong>friend</strong>, <strong>enemy</strong>,
<strong>ground</strong>. All you have to do, is to write
something like that :<br>
<br>
<strong>nero::CollisionRule rule;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule.canCollide("player", "ground");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule.canCollide("friend", "ground");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule.canCollide("enemy", "ground");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule.canCollide("player", "enemy");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule.canCollide("friend", "enemy");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule.canCollide("enemy", "enemy");<br>
rule.apply(m_RootObject);</strong><br>
<br>
the <strong>m_RootObject</strong> is the root object of
your Scene Object TreeNode, it's a member attribut of your Scene. The
apply() method, parse your Object Tree, detect all nero::PhysicObject
and configure the Category_Bits and Mask_Bits in each Box2D Fixtures.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>FullCollision
and NoCollision</strong></span><br>
<br>
the Class also offers those two convenient methods<br>
<br>
rule.fullCollision(m_RootObject);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
everything collide<br>
rule.noCollision(m_RootObject);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // nothing collide <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Limitation</strong></span><br>
<br>
You can have up to <strong>16 categories</strong>, this
limitation comes from Box2D itself.<br>
<br>
This limitation of 16 categories only concern collision filtering and
the nero::CollisionRule class, the Nero Engine itself, allows you to
define an infinite number of categories, depending on your game, you
may have to use categories for something else than collision.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Change
Collision Rules on the fly</strong></span><br>
<br>
You can change the collision rules at any moment in your game, let say
your player just picked up a potion that allows him to go through
walls, all you have to do, is to create a new instance of the
nero::CollisionRule class or call its clear() method, define the new
collision rules and call the apply() method. A better practice would be
to pre-define several collision rules, and then apply them whenener you
want.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Collision
Management | Part II : Collision Handling</strong></span><br>
<br>
Handle collisions is one the most interresting part in game
programming, this is where you can say I want that object to explode if
it get touch my super missile&nbsp; . <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Four
methods : Begin, End, PreSolve, PostSolve</strong></span><br>
<br>
A nero::Scene offers four methods to handle collision. <br>
<br>
<strong>void handleCollisionContactBegin(nero::Collision
collision);<br>
void handleCollisionContactEnd(nero::Collision collision);<br>
void handleCollisionPreSolveContact(nero::Collision collision);<br>
void handleCollisionPostSolveContact(nero::Collision collision);</strong><br>
<br>
Those four methods are called automatically when a collision occur. the
<strong>nero::Collision</strong> object carries all
information concerning the collision. For instance you can retrieve the
two nero::PhyscicObject that are colliding like that:<br>
<br>
<strong>auto objectA = collision.getObjectA()<br>
auto objectB = collision.getObjectB()</strong><br>
<br>
if you want to check what objects they are, just retrieve the category (<strong>sf::string
cat = objectA-&gt;getCategory()</strong>) or the name (<strong>sf::string
name = objectA-&gt;getName()</strong>)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>More
details on those four methods</strong></span><br>
<br>
In a previous post I have presented the four methods used by Box2D in
order to process collisions, the four ones you are seeing here, is just
a simplified version of the four methods provide by Box2D. <br>
<br>
<strong>How do they work ?</strong><br>
<br>
The <strong>Begin method /
handleCollisionContactBegin(nero::Collision collision)</strong>,
is called at the moment where two objects just collided. It means at
the first moment of the collision. This is the method that you will use
the most to process collisions.<br>
<br>
After the two objects just collided, there will be a little period of
time where they will be overlapping. During this overlapping phase the
two methods <strong>PreSolve</strong> and <strong>PostSolve</strong>
will be called alternatively and repeatedly. Those two methods may be
useful in a game logic but for now I'm not going into more details.<br>
<br>
After the overlapping phase, ours two objects are no longer colliding,
so the <strong>End method / void
handleCollisionContactEnd(nero::Collision collision)</strong>, is
called, that method just let us know that a collision just ended and
give us the opportunty to do some stuffs.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>That'
all</strong></span><br>
<br>
That's all for collisions, Collisions allow you to add diversity in
your game, you can use them in many ways, just let your imagination run
free. I did not entered into details on how or when use collisions, I
think the better way to anterstand collisions is to get our hand one it.<br>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>ActionObject
and Action</strong></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
concept</strong></span><br>
<br>
<strong>ActionObject</strong> and <strong>Action</strong>
is a interface that aim to simplify the manipulation of your game
objects. Instead of manipulate your objects directly you can
encapsulate them in a ActionObject. the ActionObject is then able to
register several Actions that you can perfom later at any time.<br>
<br>
An <strong>Action</strong> is a just a class that must
override the following method "<strong>void call(object)</strong>".
My first idea is that Actions should be <strong>Functors (C++
Function Object)</strong>, I've tried to override the "<strong>call
operator</strong>" but didn't get the result expected, so I end
up using the "<strong>void call(object)</strong>" instead.
ActionObject and Action can be used to perform <strong>instant
action like jump or dash</strong>, but they can also be used to
perform<strong> long or infinite actions</strong> like
controlling the trajectory of a moving platform.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>In
Practice</strong></span><br>
<br>
The following code is just a pseudo code, it let you get an idea of how
to use ActionObject and Action.<br>
<br>
class JumpAction : public Action<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call(Object)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// do some
stuff with the object, like apply a impulse upward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
<br>
class DashAction : public Action<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call(Object)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// do some
stuff with the object<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
<br>
auto object = enigne.findObject("player"); // find object by name<br>
ActionObject&nbsp; my_player;<br>
my_player.setObject(object);<br>
my_player.registerAction&lt;JumpAction&gt;("jump"); // the name
of the Action is given as argument, you can put what you want<br>
my_player.registerAction&lt;DashAction&gt;("dash");<br>
<br>
if(key J is pressed)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m_player.callAction("jump");&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
make your player jump<br>
else if (key D is pressed)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m_player.callAction("dash");&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
make your player dash<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Different
types of ActionObject / Action</strong></span><br>
<br>
As it already been said the code above is just a spseudo code, <strong>the
classes ActionObject and Action do not exist</strong>. Instead
you have a pair of classes for each type of objects that is manipulable.<br>
<br>
<strong>SimpleActionObject /
ObjectAction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
handle a generic nero::Object<br>
PhysicActionObject / PhysicAction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// handle a
nero::PhysciObject <br>
SpriteActionObject / SpriteAction&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;// handle a nero::SpriteObject<br>
LayerActionObject /&nbsp; LayerAction&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; // handle a nero::LayerObject<br>

Hi! here, how are you doing ! <br>
<br>
The Engine source code has been uploaded on github, you can check the
link bellow<br>
<a href="https://github.com/NeroGames/Nero-Game-Engine" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nero Game Engine Repository</a><br>
<br>
From now on, I will update the repository after each progress in the
engine development.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Need
Help for the build process !</strong></span><br>
<br>
I will be working on the build process with Cmake in the following
weeks, but I'm not an expert in Cmake, I may checkout the cmake files
of projects like&nbsp; SFML or SFGUI to find my way, but it'll take
me months before to come up with a proper build process. So if anyone
can help I'll be very thanksfull&nbsp; &nbsp;;<br>

Pack ! Thank Kenney !</strong></span><br>
<br>
I've searched for some free resources over the internet and finally
found those beautiful textures made by Kenney Vleugels. The resources
are free for both&nbsp; personnal and commercial use. The work of
this guy is just great !<br>
<br>
I've gathered some of those resoures on a github repository call
Resource Pack, check the link bellow<br>
<a href="https://github.com/sk-landry/resource-pack" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nero Game Engine Resource Pack</a><br>
<br>
The goal of the resource pack repository is to provide you all the
resources you'll need to start with the Engine. Over the time there
will be more resources like music, sound, particule and also more
texture.<br>

is my game prototype doing !</strong></span><br>
<br>
I'm currently working on my game prototype, the objective is to simply
test and improve the Engine. I'll be working on it all this month.<br>
<br>
As for now I've implemented the following features.<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>Make the camera track my player</li>
<li>Move my player</li>
<li>Multi-Jump (double jump)</li>
<li>Dash</li>
<li>Moving platform</li>
<li>Go through Platforms when jumping from bottom</li>
<li>Make my player rotate to fit the ground slope, despite it
is configured as Fixed_Rotation true</li>
<li>Remove objects at collision (It's like collecting coins or
destroying enemies)</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Nero Game Tools Library</strong></span><br>
<br>
The NGT (Nero Game Tools) Library is a sub-project of this current
project.&nbsp; It's goal is to provide a set of tools that will
allow to prototype a game in hours, or build a first version of a game
in only 2 or 3 days.<br>
<br>
The first version of this library will be composed of the tools use in
my game prototype. I plan to provide this library as a header-only
library.<br>
<br>
The library will be based on the concept of Action and ActionObject
object. In the video above the code that make my player move is the
same that make the platform move. I've just built a Move_Action that I
can provide to any Object. Therefor the NGT library will be a
collection on Action and ActionObject ready to use, you just configure
them and set it to any object in the Scene.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Second Release will come soon</strong></span><br>
<br>
After finishing with my game prototype, I will publish the first
version of the&nbsp; NGT&nbsp; Library and make a tutorial on
how to make a game from start to end with the Engine.<br>
<br>
Only after that I will add Sound Object and Animation Object to the
Engine.<br>

&nbsp;</div>
<br>
This tutorial will focus on Windows, CodeBlocks and MinGW, if you are
familiar with other tools, I'm sure you will find your way out too.
Also I will asume that you know a bit of Cmake GUI<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Step
1 : Download the Sources</strong></span><br>
<br>
All the sources are available on github<br>
<br>
Boost 1.61.0 : <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/boost" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/boostorg/boost</a><br>
Box2D 2.3.0 : <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D</a><br>
SFGUI 0.3.1 : <a href="https://github.com/TankOs/SFGUI" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/TankOs/SFGUI</a><br>
SFML 2.4.0 : <a href="https://github.com/SFML/SFML" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/SFML/SFML</a><br>
Nero 0.7.0 : <a href="https://github.com/NeroGames/Nero-Game-Engine" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/NeroGames/nero-game-engine</a><br>
<br>
The Nero project use a specific version of the others libraries, you
may try to use the latest version of the corresponding libraries, but
for this tutorial I will stay with the specific versions in order to
avoid any incompatibilities.<br>
<br>
After downloading SFML, SFGUI, Boost and Box2D, you will have to
checkout the sources in order to get the right version.<br>
<br>
It's pretty easy. Here is a exemple with SFML<br>
<br>
<strong>git clone <a href="https://github.com/SFML/SFML.git" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/SFML/SFML.git</a></strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Download the SFML source code (latest
version)<br>
<strong>cd SFML</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
Move to the SFML source directory<br>
<strong>git tag -l &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
Display all the available versions<br>
<strong>git checkout tags/2.4.0</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
Switch the code to the version 2.4.0, the command is " git checkout
tags/&lt;tag_name&gt; "<br>
<br>
And there it is, you now have the SFML 2.4.0 version, you can do the
same for Boost, Box2D, and SFGUI<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Step
2 : Build the Sources</strong></span><br>
<br>
<strong>Build Boost</strong><br>
<br>
Let's begin by the easiest one, we are going to build only the <strong>system</strong>
and the <strong>filesystem</strong> libs.<br>
<br>
for that, move into the boost source directory and issue the following
two commands one after another<br>
<br>
<strong>./bootstrap.sh</strong><br>
<strong>./b2.exe --prefix=build --with-filesystem --with-system
link=shared variant=debug,release threading=multi</strong><br>
<br>
The result of the build will be in the folder <strong>stage/lib</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Build Box2D, SFML and SFGUI</strong><br>
<br>
Box2D, SFML and SFGUI can be build easly with Cmake GUI<br>
<br>
SFGUI depends of SFML, if Cmake does not find SFML, you can define the <strong>Path</strong>
option <strong>SFML_ROOT</strong>.<br>
<br>
the sfml root directory should look like this<br>
sfml_root_path/inlcude/SFML
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//contains
the sfml headers<br>
sfml_root_path/lib
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //constains the
sfml libs (.a files with MinGW)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Step
3 : Build Nero</strong></span><br>
<br>
After building Boost, Box2D, SFML and SFGUI you can now build the Nero
project using Cmake GUI.<br>
<br>
If Cmake does not find boost, you can define the <strong>Path</strong>
option <strong>BOOST_ROOT</strong><br>
<br>
the boost root directory should look like this <br>
boost_root_path/inlcude/boost&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;//contains the boost headers<br>
boost_root_path/lib&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;//constains the
boost libs (.a files previously build)<br>
<br>
If Cmake does not find SFML, you can Define the path option <strong>SFML_ROOT</strong>
like for SFGUI<br>
<br>
If Cmake does not find Box2D or SFGUI you will have to configure
manually the following cmake options.<br>
<br>
BOX2D_INCLUDE_DIR<br>
BOX2D_LIBRARY_DEBUG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
BOX2D_LIBRARY_RELEASE<br>
<br>
SFGUI_INCLUDE_DIR<br>
SFGUI_LIBRARY_DEBUG<br>
SFGUI_LIBRARY_RELEASE<br>
<br>
If you have built Box2D and SFGUI in Release and Debug mode, you can
provide the two libs version, if not, providing either the Debug or
Release libs will be enough. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Step
4 : Organise your Libs</strong></span><br>
<br>
When you build a library you can choose where the libs will be install.
Libraries like Boost have default installation path, so cmake or any
IDE or compiler can find them easily. Personnaly I use a custom folder
call "Library" to store all my libs. It's easy to find them if I know
they are all in one place. Choose the method that suits you the best.<br>
<br>
In the next section I will assume that you have all the libs in a
folder "Library" like this:<br>
<br>
Library/include
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//contains
all the libraries headers<br>
Library/inlcude/SFML<br>
Library/inlcude/Box2D<br>
Library/inlcude/SFGUI<br>
Library/inlcude/boost<br>
Library/inlcude/json
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
one can be find in the Nero project source files, under the "extlibs"
directory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Library/inlcude/easyloggingpp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// "extlibs"
directory also<br>
<br>
Library/lib&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;//
contains all the libraries libs (.a files with MingW)<br>
Library/bin&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //
conatains all the DLL files<br>
Library/doc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// the
libs doc<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Step
5 : Link the lilbraries</strong></span><br>
<br>
Now that you have all the libs and DLL ready, you can create a new
Project and make the following configurations.<br>
<br>
On CodeBlocks, all of this is done in (Project --&gt; Build Options)<br>
<br>
activate the c++11
flag&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Project
--&gt; Build Options --&gt; Compiler Settings --&gt;
Compiler flags)<br>
add the headers path
"Libray/include"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Project
--&gt; Build Options --&gt; Search directories --&gt;
Compiler)<br>
add the libs path
"Library/lib"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Project
--&gt; Build Options --&gt; Search directories --&gt;
Linker)<br>
add the dll path
"Library/bin"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Project
--&gt; Build Options --&gt; Search directories --&gt;
Linker)<br>
<br>
link all the libs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Project
--&gt; Build Options --&gt; Linker settings --&gt; Link
libraries <strong>and/or</strong> --&gt; Other linker
options)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Step
6 : Mandatory directories</strong></span><br>
<br>
After linking the libs, there is one more thing to do, the Engine
expect some directories and files to be available.<br>
<br>
Resource/<br>
Resource/Texture/<br>
Resource/Font/<br>
Resource/Font/Sansation.ttf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
<strong>This is one is important, the Engine use it for text
rendering</strong><br>
<br>
config/<br>
config/log_config&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//Pretty
important, but not necessary<br>
<br>
You can download those directories here : <a href="https://github.com/NeroGames/resource-pack/blob/master/Directory.zip" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/NeroGames/resource-pack/blob/master/Directory.zip</a><br>
Unzip the file and copy its content in your project directory<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>That's
All</strong></span><br>
<br>
This post described all the steps you'll need to get start with the
Engine. Build and Link libraries is one of the most difficult part when
working on C++ programs. It may give you some headaches&nbsp; &nbsp;
<img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/shocked.gif" alt=":o" title="Shocked" class="smiley"> . So
try again and again if it does not work and feel free to ask any
question in case of difficulties. <br>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Nero
Game Engine Startup Kit</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi every how are you doing !<br>
<br>
The kit is now ready, you can download it with the link bellow. The kit
works like a Codeblocks standalone installation. you can carry it in a
USB key and launch it wherever you want. It uses a 32 bits MinGW
compiler, so it should run on any Windows System.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1THDFW4btsftdUqcacMjEqo81VKy7gGUS/view?usp=sharing" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downlaod Nero Game Engine Kit</a><br>
<br>
The Kit already contains two projects. One call "<strong>Test</strong>"
that you can use as you want, and another call "<strong>Kero</strong>",
I will talk about this one later.<br>
<br>
The content of the Kit is as bellow<br>
<br>
<strong>CodeBlocks</strong>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CodeBlocks
and MinGW installation<br>
<strong>Library</strong>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
the necessary headers, dlls and libs<br>
<strong>Projects</strong>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
your projects should be created in this folder<br>
<strong>Resource Pack</strong>/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
set of Textures and Fonts<br>
<strong>Readme</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
readme file<br>
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double
click on this one to start CodeBlock;<br>
<br>
<strong>There is nothing to configure, every new project has
automatically access to the engine API</strong><br>
<br>
When you create a new project, there is only one thing to do. The
Engine expect the "<strong>config/</strong>" and "<strong>Resource/</strong>"
directories to be availabed. So don't forget to add them. You can
simply copy the ones in the "<strong>Test</strong>" project
in your New project directory.<br>

this post we'll see how to start programming with the Engine<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>1-
Create a new Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
In order to create a new Scene, you simply have to create a new Class
inherating from <strong>nero::Scene</strong>. After that
you can add&nbsp; your scene to the Engine with the method [ <strong>addScene&lt;Scene_Class&gt;("scene_name")</strong>
]. you can add any number of Scenes.<br>
<br>
Pay attention to the scene name, the name will be used to generate a
directory for your scene, So the characters you can enter there depends
on your Operating System rules in term of Folder and File Name.<br>
<br>
The Engine Instantiate your Scene each time you click on the <strong>Play_Button</strong>.<br>

change the code in the main like bellow.<br>

No More DevScene</strong></span><br>
<br>
In some previous posts you may saw that a <strong>Scene</strong>
could be created by inheriting from a <strong>nero::DevScene</strong>,
this is no longer the case. <br>
The <strong>DevEngine</strong> is only able to manage some
<strong>nero::DevScene</strong>, so in principle you should
only add DevScenes to it. In contrast the <strong>RenderEngine</strong>
is only able to manage some <strong>nero::Scene</strong>.
Switching between the DevScene engine and the RenderEngine, was
requiring to manually change the inheratance of a Scene every time. I
founded that combersome so, I made some changes.<br>
<br>
Now only nero::Scenes are added to the DevEngine, and it is its
responsibility to automatically generate a DevScene that will
encapsulate the nero::Scene. With that, there is no change to made in a
Scene when moving from the DevEngine to the RenderEngine and vis versa.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>5-
The&nbsp; nero::GameEngine</strong></span><br>
<br>
You never heard about this Class. The reason is simply because it
doesn't exist yet. The Nero project is based on three seperated Engines.<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>a <strong>Dev Engine</strong>, its role is to
accelerate the development of a Game scene.</li>
<li>a <strong>Render Engine</strong>, its role is
to facilitate Scene distribution, if you want a friend or a colleage to
test a particular scene, put it in the RenderEngine and share it.</li>
<li>a <strong>Game Engine</strong>, its role is to
hold a entire Game, a Game with multiple Scenes and&nbsp; Menus.
Its particularity is to have a <strong>Scene_Stack</strong>
and a way to switch between Scenes and Menus easly.</li>
</ul>
A this stage of the project, the GameEngine is not a requirement, so I
put it away for now.<br>

to code with the Engine Series</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone, after the 101 (see the above post), we can now move
further and see how to code with the engine.<br>
<br>
As I made with the DevEngine Interface, I will made a series of posts
to show how to develop a Game with the Engine.<br>
<br>
In the Engine Kit there is the project Kero. this project is my game
prototype, more exactly the quater of it. I design the prototype in
four parts. You can take a look at the code to see how it works. The 3
others parts of the prototype will be part of this tutorial.<br>
<br>
bellow you can see the outline of this new series of posts<br>

<div class="inner" id="msg_162285"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to code with the Engine Part 1-1 : The nero logger</strong></span><br>
<br>
Log things is pretty useful when programming, this is why I wanted to
start this series of Howtos with the logger.<br>
The Engine use the <strong>Easyloggingcpp library</strong>
for logging. the default synthax look like this&nbsp; <br>
<strong>[ LOG(INFO) &lt;&lt; "log message here, this goes
to the console" ]</strong><br>
If you ever used that library and are familiar with it, you can still
use its default synthax.<br>
<br>
I prefer function-like synthax, this is why I design the <strong>[
nero_log() ]</strong> and <strong>[ nero_log_if() ]</strong>
functions to replace the original synthax. Those functions are in fact <strong>Macros</strong>,
this is why they don't use the nero namepsace.<br>
<br>
Here is a overview of these two functions<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">nero_log<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span>message<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><br>
nero_log<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span>message,
level<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><br>
nero_log_if<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span>message,
boolean<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><br>
nero_log_if<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span>message,
boolean, level<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><br>
&nbsp;</div>
<br>
Two levels are availabled. Not specifing a level is equivalent to use
the logger in <strong>INFO</strong> level<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">nero<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">::</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 119, 136);">Debug</span><br>

&nbsp;</div>
<br>
In addition to the logger Macros, you also got some toString Macros<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">_s<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span>value<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span> &nbsp;

to code with the Engine Part 1-2 :&nbsp; Use constants</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Engine use a lot of <strong>Strings</strong> to do its
stuffs. Objects in a Scene are identified by they Name and they
Category. The Names and Categories are used everywhere and many time in
the code, writting them every time is error prone, so as a good
practice, this Strings should be declared as constants and maintained
in one place. Also notice that Names and Categories should be unique.<br>
<br>
As an example the kero project defined several constants in the
Kero_utility.h file like this.<br>

to code with the Engine Part 1-3 :&nbsp; Check Objects</strong></span><br>
<br>
Any Object can be retrieved at any moment with a&nbsp; <strong>[
m_ObjectManager.findObject("object_name") ] </strong>. The thing
to know is that the <strong>Object_Manager</strong> return
a <strong>Null_Ptr</strong> when it does not found a
Object. The reasons the Object_Manager does not found a object may be
because the Object simply does not exist, may be you misspelled the <strong>Object_Name</strong>,
or you simply forget to assign the name with the Dev_Engine Interface.
So in principle you should test any returned object before to use it
like that.<br>

<br>
This is pretty combersome. In order to reduce the risk of using
unexisting Objects, you can check them all at the beginning of the
init() method.<br>
the method <strong>[
m_ObjectManger.checkAllObject(std::vector&lt;sf::String&gt;) ]</strong>
is there for that. you can give it all the <strong>Object_Names</strong>
you will be using. If it found that a object does not exist, it throws
a exception and give you the culprit, I means the Object_Name, that
refer to nothing.<br>

<br>
The findObject() method, run other the whole <strong>Object_Tree_Node</strong>
to find an Object. This may be resource and time consuming if your
Scene contains too many Objects. You can optimize the research if you
know the nature of the Object you are looking up for.<br>
<br>
If the Object is a Physic_Object by example, use the findPhysicObject()
method, This method will skip all layer that does not contain Physic
Objects during its look up process.<br>

ActionObject can be used to create moving platorm or to make move any
PhysicObject. <br>
<br>
There is little change in the schedule, the HowTo on the Player will
come after the one on Collision. That said, let's begin.<br>

The <strong>Nero Game Lib library</strong>&nbsp;
defined some custom <strong>Actions</strong> and <strong>ActionObjects</strong>.
This library is not part of The Engine Core, currently it is provided
as a header only library. You can find it in the package in : <strong>Library\gamelib\NERO\gamelib.h</strong><br>
Further in the tutorial I will show How to create custom Actions and
ActionObjects. For now let's use the ones provided in the gamelib
library.<br>

Add the SimpleMovingObject to the Object Tree</strong></span><br>
<br>
The role of an <strong>ActionObject</strong> is to provide
a behavior to another Object (<strong>the Target</strong>).
As we want our ActionObject to have full control of the target, we will
first remove the target from the Object Tree, and then give it to the
ActionObject. Only after that we can add the ActionObject to the Object
Tree<br>
<br>
We create the ActionObject as a Pointer since it will be added to the
Object_Tree<br>

Some reminders</strong></span><br>
<br>
The <strong>SimpleMovingObject</strong> is a <strong>PhysicActionObject</strong>,
currently it's the only ActionObject in the gamelib library. As a
PhysicActionObject, it handles only <strong>PhysicObjects</strong>
(SolidObjects are also PhysicObjects).<br>
<br>
This ActionObject should be used on <strong>Kinematic</strong>
PhysicObject. <br>
<br>
Static Objects are not meant to move and Dynamic Objects are meant to
be affected by a lot of things (gravity, collisions) what is not ideal
for this ActionObject.<br>

Hi everyone, hope you are doing great. Let's continue this series with
Collisons processing<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>1-
Setup the collision rules</strong></span><br>
<br>
Let's consider the following Object Categories (<strong>ground</strong>,
<strong>platform</strong>, <strong>cirlce</strong>,
<strong>cube</strong>) and the following rules<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>circles and cubes can collide with ground</li>
<li>only circles can collide with platforms</li>
<li>circles cannot collide with circles</li>
<li>cubes can collide with cubes</li>
<li>circles and cubes cannot collide</li>
</ul>
using a <strong>nero::CollisionRule</strong> object you
can configure this setup with the code bellow<br>
<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">nero<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">::</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 119, 136);">CollisionRule</span>

<br>
When the <strong>apply()</strong> method is called, the
collisionRule object first remove all previous collision configuration
by calling the <strong>noCollision()</strong> method. When
this method is called, no object can collide with any other object,
this is why you only have to tell which Category should collide with
which one when setting up the rules.<br>
<br>
<strong>2- Print the collision rule</strong><br>
<br>
if you want to see the collision rules in a more readable way, you can
called the print() method<br>
<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">collisionRule.<span style="color: rgb(0, 119, 136);">print</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">;</span></div>

to code with the engine Part 1-7 : Build a simple player</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone, hope you are doing great. Let's continue with the series.<br>
<br>
In this post I will show how to use an ActionObject and some Actions in
order the build a simple player<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Step
0 : Include the Nero GameLib header</strong></span><br>
<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 0);">#include
&lt;NERO/gamelib.h&gt;</span></div>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Step
1 : Create the player object</strong></span><br>
<br>
The first step is to create the object that will be your player using
the Dev_Engine_Interface. For this example we can take a simple cube or
circle to be the player. So let's create a Physic_Object (Polygon Mesh)
with the name <strong>"my_player"</strong> and the
category <strong>"player"</strong> <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>step
2 : Use an ActionOject to represent the Player</strong></span><br>
<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">nero<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">::</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 119, 136);">PhysicActionObject</span>

<br>
In the Howto on <strong>Moving Objects and Platforms</strong>,
we used a Custom PhysicActionObject called SimpleMovingObject. The
SimpleMovingObject inherit from PhysicActionObject in order to build a
more complex interface. But as you can see the default interface of the
PhysicActionObject is enough for certain cases. There are many ways to
use ActionObject and Action, and for this tutorial we are using the
most basic one.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>step
3 : Give the player defferent capabilities </strong></span><br>
<br>
Let's say we want our player to be able to move right and left. we also
want it to be able to jump.<br>
<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">float</span>

In the code above we've registered three Actions, the player can then
perform those actions when ever it want.<br>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to code with the engine Part 1-8 : Anatomy of the Kero Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone, how are you doing&nbsp; . I
thought to change this post title, but I finally kept it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>A
litte story</strong></span><br>
<br>
There is the story of the Kero scene<br>
<br>
once upon a time, there was a little cube with the power to move left
and right. After a long long run, the little cube find a blue arrow.
The arrow was moving up and down. Intrigued by this arrow the little
cube decided to touch it, when it did, some thing amazing happened, the
little cube get the power to jump. With its new power the little cube
continue its aventure, it later found a moving platform, that was a
great opportunity to test its new power, It jumped on the platform
which carried it to the beginning of a new aventure.<br>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Build
a game with the Nero Game Engine</strong></span><br>
<br>
As you may have seen with the Kero Scene, there are basically&nbsp;
two parts when developing a game with the Engine. I called them the<strong>
Game Scene</strong> part and the <strong>Game Code</strong>
part.<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>The Game Scene</li>
</ul>
The game scene is built with the Dev Engine Interface, the game scene
can be modified at any time without the need rewrite the code. That is
great if you want to tweak the position or the shape of an object.
Modifing the Game Scene also don't required to recompile your game
program, and since the scene is represented as a simple json file, it's
easy to share. If you think you are not good at Scene disign just ask a
friend to build the scene for you and send you the json file (and also
the sprites, ya don't forget them ).<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>The Game Code</li>
</ul>
The game code is where the logic is built. In the game code you can
retrieve the objects created in the game scene and manage collisions
and events. The modification of the game code require the recompilation
of the game program. With this series you get a look at the engine API.
The API is pretty generic and does not target a game genre. If you like
a specific game genre you can build your own API on top of the engine
one like I did with the Nero Game Lib. I'm a fan of plaftormers so the
Nero Game Lib will focus only on the platformer genre.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Learn
more and continue the development</strong></span><br>
<br>
The part 2 of the series is put in stand by. I won't have time to work
on that in the following months. In place of that I will focus my time
on learning game engine architecture and continue the development of
the Engine (I will be working on Sound and Animation objects). <br>
<br>
I'm pretty happy with the current state of the project considering that
I taught&nbsp; my self C++ programming, SFML and game programming.
I'm not a game engine expert, I came to that stage of the project using
my intuition and determination. But I think it's time to learn some key
notions on engine development. I came accross that book Game Engine
Architecture of Jason gregory and found it pretty amazing. I will
gather many others books and learn a lot in order to produce the best
engine I can.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi everyone ! it's been a long time since my last post. Hope you are
doing well&nbsp; .<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>A
new logo design</strong></span><br>
<br>
Here is the new design I made for the logo. Let me know what you think.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.pinimg.com/originals/70/2e/95/702e95afbb92820e8226cba51449aa42.png" alt="" class="bbc_img resized" style="cursor: pointer;" width="600"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>TexturePacker</strong></span><br>
<br>
Do you know TexturePacker from CodeAndWeb. It's a tool that easy the
creation of Sprite Sheet. If you have a bunch of PNG files by example,
you can import them in TexturePacker and it will "pack" them into one
single PNG file. The geat thing, it's that it also provide you a JSON
file (not only, there are other formats) describing the Sheet, so
the&nbsp; Sprite Sheet can be easily "decoded" by a game engine.<br>
<br>
As I mention in my last post I'm currently working on Animation. Before
I started implementing anything I searched over the internet if I could
find a tool that will simplify the creation of animation. That lead me
to TexturePacker. <br>
<br>
TexturePacker will be integrated in my Engine workflow. I will talk
more about that when the integration with the engine it's done. For now
you can learn more about <a href="https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TexturePacker
here</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Development
Progress</strong></span><br>
<br>
The development of the Engine progress very slowly these days since I
don't have munch time to work on it. But with a little chance things
can change in the upcoming months.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi everyone !, I'm back, how do you do ?<br>
<br>
During the last two weeks I got a lot of free time, so I worked on the
Engine. The Engine has evolved, I added some new features and fixed
some bugs. I've made a review of the features that will be availabled
in the Engine first version. The first version will be ready by the end
on this year. The integration of Lua as a scripting language will take
a lot of time, so for the first version there will only be a very
minimalist integration of Lua. C++ will be the main language to use the
Engine. Finally I plan to open a website early next year, maybe on
Junuary.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
that's said, Let's jump on the new features !!!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Startup
Screen</strong></span><br>
<br>
The DevEngine now has a Startup Screen or a Loading Screen if you
prefer. The Engine just use two threads on startup. While the main
thread render the Loading Screen, a second thread load Resources and
build the Engine_UI in background.<br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tshPLzr8JN8?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Custom
Startup Screen</strong></span><br>
<br>
While the DevEngine has a fix Startup Screen, the RenderEngine can take
a custom Startup Screen. That allows you to create your own game
loading screen. In order to create a Startup Screen you simply have to
create a class that henerite from nero::StartupScreen<br>
<br>
<div class="spoiler">
<div class="spoilerheader"></div>
</div>
<div class="spoiler">
<div class="spoilerheader"> (click to show/hide)</div>
</div>
<br>
All the methods in the class are virtual pure; you have to override all
of them.<br>
the getBackgroundColor() method return a color to clear the
sf::RenderWindow; <br>
the getMintime() method return a time in second. It allows you to
choose if the LoadingScreen should last in 5 second or 10 second or
whatever you want. <br>
<br>
the Custom Startup Screen is given to the RenderEngine via it's
constructor.<br>
<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">MyStartupScreen
myStartupScreen<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">;</span><br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Sound
and Music</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Engine can now load and manage Sound and Music. Like other
resources the loading is automatic. Just copy some sounds in the folder
"/Resource/Sound" and some musics in the folder "/Resource/Music", the
Engine will take care the rest. In your Scene class, there is a
instance of the class <strong>nero::SoundManager</strong>.
this class let you play a sound or a music at any time in your game.<br>
<br>
The DevEngine allows to quickly access all your Musics and Sounds, so
you can enjoy them while building a Scene.<br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2NmvLW6bSaY?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Configuration
Files</strong></span><br>
<br>
In order to make the Engine more flexible, many hard coded properties
are now made evailable as configurations. Configuration files are JSON
files, they are all located in the folder "/config"<br>
<br>
As a example, for each resource type (Texture, Sound, Music etc), you
can now choose the folder where to put them, you can also choose the
extensions you want to handle.<br>
<br>
For Fonts, you can choose what Font to use as default.<br>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Bug
fixed : RenderCanvas glitch</strong></span><br>
<br>
In the version of the Engine provided with the SDK (Startup Kit), there
is a glitch on the Canvas when you remove a Layer or when the Redo and
Undo buttons are used. It tooks me some time to find the reason of this
glitch, but it's now fixed.<br>
<br>
that's all for this post, There are other new features like Animation
and Grid, they are still in development, I will talk about them another
day. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="post">
<div class="inner" id="msg_164911">Hi everyone !,
hope you are doing greet&nbsp; . Today
let's talk about Animation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Animation
Tools</strong></span><br>
<br>
In order to simplify Animations management the Nero Engine relies on
other tools. Texture Packer and ShoeBox.<br>
<br>
<strong>Texture packer</strong><br>
<br>
I've already talked about this one. It's a tool that let you pack
several images in one Spritesheet.<br>
When you use Texture Packer to pack your animation, you obtain two
files. A image file (.png, .jpeg, etc) and a Json file. The Nero Engine
relies on this two files to generate animations.<br>
<br>
<strong>ShoeBox</strong><br>
<br>
What is ShoeBox ? ShoeBox also allows to pack image files. But the
great thing is that it also allows to <strong>Unpack Spritesheets</strong>.
When you search for animations over the internet, most of the time you
will find some animation SpriteSheets. And there come a question : The
animation is already packed, how am I going to use it in Texture packer
?. Well,&nbsp; ShoeBox can unpack SpriteSeets, it can also unpack
GIF images. Yep, If you have an animation in GiF format, you can unpack
it using an online service or with ShoeBox.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://renderhjs.net/shoebox/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShoeBox is
free, you can find it here.</a><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Load
Animation</strong></span><br>
<br>
When you obtain the two files generated by Texture Packer, you simply
have to copy and paste them in the "/Resource/Animation" directory. The
rest is automatic, the Engine read your files and build the Animations.<br>
<br>
In the picture bellow, you can see that each animation is made of one
PNG file and one JSON file. Both files must have the same name.<br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/56/a9/60/56a960914b3c3fbec6e893600487f772.png" alt="" class="bbc_img"><img style="width: 516px; height: 103px;" alt="" src="56a960914b3c3fbec6e893600487f772.png"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Animation
Object</strong></span><br>
<br>
On the left of the Engine Interface, There is now an Animation Tab. All
loaded animations can be founded there. Animations work like Sprites.
If you put the mouse over an Animation_Button you can see a Preview.<br>
If you click on a Animation_Button you add a Animation_Object onto the
Canvas.<br>
<br>
Animations are like any other Object, you can move them arround, Rotate
them, Scale them, Duplication them etc.<br>
<br>
Like Sprite, you can change the Color of your Animation, simply select
the Animation Object and process like if it was a Sprite Object.<br>
<br>
A Layer of Animations appears with a Yellow color, this is temporary I
will review all the Colors for Layer's types<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Animations
and Physics</strong></span><br>
<br>
Again the process is the same as for Sprite_Object. Hold <strong>CRTL
and Click</strong> on a Animation_Button to add a
Animation_Meshed_Object onto the Canvas. When a Animation_Meshed_Object
is selected you can go to the Mesh Tab and change the properties of its
Mesh Object. When you build your Scene by clicking on the "Return key"
or the "Play Button" the Animation_Meshed_Object becomes a
Animation_Solid_Object.<br>
<br>
A Layer of Animation_Meshed_Object appears with a Light Blue color,
this is a temporary color;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Animation
Sequences</strong></span><br>
<br>
An Animation is made of Sequences. Each animation has at least one
sequence. If the Animation concerns a character we usally have
something like ("idle", "walk", "run", "jump"). If the Animation
concerns a simple background object like flowers or animals you simply
have one sequence.<br>
<br>
When you add an Animation Object onto the canvas, the Animation has
it's default sequence selected.&nbsp; In order to do that, the
Engine need to know the name of the default sequence.&nbsp; For a
character the default sequence is the "idle" sequence. But for a none
character animation is it called "idle" ? I had three choices : "idle",
"default", "The name of the animation". I took the last one. <br>
<br>
If you have an Animation called "player" and the following seqences
("idle", "walk", "run", "jump"), the Engine will expect you to name
your sequences as followed<br>
("player", "walk", "run", "jump").<br>
<br>
If you have a Animation called "flower" whith one sequence, the engine
will expect that sequence to be called "flower".<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Sequence Tab</strong></span><br>
<br>
Alongside with the Sprite, Animation and other Tabs, you now have the
Sequence Tab. By default this Tab is empty, but when you select an
Animation Object, the Sequence Tab shows all the Sequences available
for the selected Animation Object.<br>
<br>
From this tab you can configure the frame rate of each sequence. the
value is in hertz (inverse of second). If you choose of frame rate of
"10", it means "1/10 second";<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/6c/5d/0e/6c5d0ed3b6e48415999d6f73d67680f0.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img"><br>
<img style="width: 215px; height: 422px;" alt="" src="6c5d0ed3b6e48415999d6f73d67680f0.jpg"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Animation
is not Just Animation</strong></span><br>
<br>
You can see a <strong>nero::AnimationObject</strong> like
a nero::SpriteObject that have the power to change is internal Sprite
whenever it want. Imagine you have a breakable object in your game.
That object will have several state ("healthy", "half break", "break").
This is not a animation, but it can be represented whith a Animation
Object.<br>
<br>
In order to say to a Animation to stop being a animation, you simply
have to tell him to never update itself<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">animation_object<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 64);">-</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">&gt;</span>setUpdateable<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">false</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">;</span></div>
<br>
After that you have the power to controle the animation manually.<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">animation_object<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 64);">-</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">&gt;</span>setFrame<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 221);">0</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span> <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">// by default the object

complety broken let go to the last frame</span></div>
<br>
that's all for Animation, I will make a post later today in order to
present other new features. <br>
Here is a video that shows how Animation looks like<br>

<div class="inner" id="msg_164913">Hi again ! Now
the Engine have Animations (see the post above), but that's not all. In
this post I will show all the new features I've been working on<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Merge
Layer</strong></span><br>
<br>
It is now possible to merge two layers. The only condition is that,
they have to be of the same type (the same color).<br>
On the Right of the Engine there are two new buttons: "Merge UP" and
"Merge Down". <br>
When you merge up by example, the content of the currently selected
layer is taken and added to the layer above.<br>
<img style="width: 223px; height: 227px;" alt="" src="5b3c87b7318c8fa5880f7480ab28eb75.png"><br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5b/3c/87/5b3c87b7318c8fa5880f7480ab28eb75.png" alt="" class="bbc_img"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Axis icon</strong></span><br>
<br>
On the bottom left of the Canvas there is now a Icon that shows the
direction of the X and Y axis. I saw this in Blender so I thought it
would be cool to have one in the Engine&nbsp; . The
Icon rotate when the Camera rotate. You can hide it if you want, just
uncheck the "Axis" check box on the Right of the Engine Interface.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dc/08/33/dc0833412f949568e050f16b724ff60e.png" alt="" class="bbc_img"><img style="width: 134px; height: 80px;" alt="" src="dc0833412f949568e050f16b724ff60e.png"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Scale
preview with Mouse Wheel</strong></span><br>
<br>
When the mouse is over a Sprite_Button or a Animation_Button, you can
now scale the preview with the Mouse Wheel. Previously the Divide_Key
and Multiply_Key were used, but using the Mouse Wheel is more
fun&nbsp; .<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Mesh
Edition, Axe aligned movement</strong></span><br>
<br>
Mesh edition can be tough sometimes. In certain cases you want to move
a vertex, only vertically or only horizontally but your mouse just
doesn't want to let you do that. Now you don't have to be an expert at
moving the mouse to do what you want. I made a little change in the
algorithm. When moving a vertex, a line or an entire mesh, if your
movement is more vertical than horizontal the Engine will assume that
your movement is only vertical.<br>
<br>
Example : we have a vertex at (1, 1). we apply a movement of (2, 4).
the result should be (1+2, 1+4) = (2, 5).<br>
but now the engine say, abs(4) &gt; abs(2) so lets apply a movement
of (0, 4) instead, the movement is nullify on the x Axis.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Canvas Grid</strong></span><br>
<br>
This feature is still in development. By default the Grid is Hidden,
you can make it visible by checking the "Grid" check box on the Right
of the Engine.<br>
<br>
What I am trying to do here is a "Infinite" Grid. When the Grid is Axe
aligned there is no problem to simulate an "Infinite" Grid, you can
move the Camera vertically or horizontally as you want, the Grid will
adapt itself. But When the Grid is rotated, it becomes difficult to
simulate "Infinity".<br>
<br>
For now I am just playing with this feature I don't know exactly what
it will be.<br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUJv06mcuLc?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Lua
Script</strong></span><br>
<br>
The integration of Lua in the Engine is beginning slowly. Each
nero::Scene now have a instance of a&nbsp; "Lua State" called "L".
All the Lua standard libraries are loaded by default. If you have some
experience with Lua and C++ you can already begin to call your scripts
in your nero::Scene Class.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Github
updated</strong></span><br>
<br>
The <a href="https://github.com/NeroGames/Nero-Game-Engine" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repository</a> have
been updated. we are now at the version 0.8.0 . The code is not stable,
I will have to review the code to make sure every is right. When it's
done I will publish a new version of the SDK with all the new features.
If you like the project don't forget to give a start to the project on
Github<br>
<br>
<br>
That's all for now. thank you for reading my posts and see you later.<br>

<div class="inner" id="msg_165003"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Nero Adventure Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone, how do you do.<br>
<br>
In order to complet the Engine and reach the first version, I needed to
work on a concrete Game Scene. So I took the code of my game prototype
and begin to update it. I gave up on the name "Kero", it's now call the
"Nero Adventure Scene". The artwork I'am using is from the <a href="http://www.openpixelproject.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Pixel
Project</a> and the <a href="http://www.kenney.nl/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenney Asset Store</a>.<br>
<br>
The Scene will be composed of 5 parts:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1- A Startup Screen (display when the
Render Engine start)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2- A Game Menu Screen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3- A Game Scene (the actual game)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4- A Pause Screen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5- A Credit Screen (display when you
finish the game) <br>
<br>
The idea is to cover most of the Engine features. The code develop in
this game will be added in the "Nero Game Lib" library.<br>
<br>
Here is a first look of the main character <br>

</div>
<div class="post">
<div class="inner" id="msg_165924">Hi everyone !.
Hope your are doing great.&nbsp; <br>
I made a lot of progress on the Engine development, I had not enough
time to write a post, so there will be a lot to say.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Text
Object</strong></span><br>
<br>
New object types have been added in the Engine. Let's begin by the Text
Object.<br>
<br>
On the left of the Engine Interface, along with the Sprite Tab, there
is a new Tab named Text. From this Tab you can create some Text Objects
and edit their properties.<br>
<br>
Like other object types, a Text_Object can be moved, rotated, scaled,
duplicated etc. <br>
<br>
When a Text Object is selected you can change its <strong>font</strong>,
its <strong>font size</strong> (character size), its <strong>outline
thickness</strong> and its <strong>style (bold, italic,
underline, linethrough)</strong>.<br>
<br>
From the Color_Tab you can change the text color but also the text
outline color.<br>
<br>
I'm currently using SFML 2.4.1, in the latest versions of SFML, there
are two other text properties : <strong>Latter Spacing</strong>
and <strong>Line Spacing</strong>. I will add those
properties when I update SFML.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Write
a New Line.</strong></span><br>
<br>
In order to return to the line when writting the text of your Text
Object, you must insert a <strong>special character</strong>.
By default it is&nbsp; <strong>the pipe ( | ) character</strong>.
You can choose the character you want my modifying the configuration
file <strong>config/engine_config.json</strong>. The
property is named <strong>carriage_return</strong><br>
<br>
It's more easy to explain with a video. So here is one.<br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQNqCKycXhc?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Re-order
Object</strong></span><br>
<br>
There are now two buttons allowing to move a Object Up or Down in the
current Layer.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/a3/76/3ea37664544b04be9e5b7fe4ca4f17eb.png" alt="" class="bbc_img"><img style="width: 218px; height: 122px;" alt="" src="3ea37664544b04be9e5b7fe4ca4f17eb.png"><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Default
file/directory generation</strong></span><br>
<br>
In a previous post, I said the Engine need some directories and files
to be available in order to work properly. For example we have the <strong>resource
directory</strong> and all its sub directories, the <strong>log
configuration file</strong>, the <strong>Sansation font</strong>,
and some new config files I added recently.<br>
<br>
From now on the Engine will generate those files and directories
automatically on startup if they do not exist.<br>
<br>
There are many configuration files in the config directory, If you made
some changes on them and want to revert the changes, just delete them,
the engine will bring them back.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Log View</strong></span><br>
<br>
Bellow the Engine Canvas you got the <strong>Log View</strong>.
It is now possible to log in this area from a nero::Scene. Each
nero::Scene now provide a function <strong>void log(std::string
message)</strong> that print its message in the Log view. This
function internally call the <strong>nero_log(message)</strong>
function, so the message will be also print in the console. <br>
<br>
If you create a new class and want to log from this class to the Log
View it's pretty easy. The log function is store in a <strong>std::function&lt;void(string)&gt;</strong>,
you can retrieve it with the nero::Scene function<strong> getLog()</strong>
and give it to your class;<br>
<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">myNewClass.<span style="color: rgb(0, 119, 136);">setLog</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span> getLog<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">;</span></div>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>FrameRate
and FrameTime</strong></span><br>
<br>
From a nero::Scene it is now possible to retrieve the FrameRate and
FrameTime with <strong>float getFrameRate()</strong> and <strong>float
getFrameTime()</strong>.<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>The frame rate is the number frame in one
second.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The frame time is the duration of one frame
in seconds.</strong></li>
</ul>
The Engine Interface show its own frameRate and frameTime at the Canvas
bottom right. The Engine Interface frameRate is not the actual Game
frameRate. Since the Engine Interface manage more things, the Game
frameRate will be higher.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/80/a6/9b/80a69bfc86ec77f9a2881e0445a0e4ff.png" alt="" class="bbc_img"><br>
<img style="width: 275px; height: 79px;" alt="" src="80a69bfc86ec77f9a2881e0445a0e4ff.png"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>All
nero::Scene Attributes Private</strong></span><br>
<br>
All the attributes in a nero::Scene are now private. Attributes will be
accessed by some getters and setters.<br>
<br>
It's no longer possible to write : <br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">m_ObjectManager<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 64);">-</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">&gt;</span>findObject<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span>name<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span></div>
Now you will have to write : <br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">getObjectManager<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 64);">-</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">&gt;</span>findObject<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span>name<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span></div>
<br>
The objective is to secure the nero::Scene class. If a variable can be
modified there will a setter, if a variable can be accessed there will
be getter. This offer a more clean interface.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Last
active Scene.</strong></span><br>
<br>
If you are working on several Scenes at the same time, you may switch
between Scenes many time. From now on, if you close the Engine and
restart it, the Engine will remember the last Scene you were working
on, and will select it on Startup.<br>
<br>
If the Engine is close properly via the <strong>Window close
button</strong> or the <strong>Quit button</strong>
above the Canvas, the Engine will save all your scenes befor to
shutdown.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>That's all for this post. There are more changes in the
Engine, but those will be for another post. Have a good day !</strong>&nbsp;

<div class="inner" id="msg_165988">Hi everyone, how
are you doing ! Let's continous with the Engine Updates.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Fix
Game loop</strong></span><br>
<br>
When playing with my Adventure Scene I notices that the game speed was
not stable. Sometime the game accelerate, some time it slow down. The
default loop speed is 60 FPS. This is a fixed time, so it surprised me
to have that issue. But after inspecting the Engine game loop I saw
that the rendering was done in the while loop.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Grid</strong></span><br>
<br>
I now completed the Grid feature. I give up on the idea to build an
infinite Grid. Building a grid that update it self when the camera
moves is pretty complex and I didn't have time to do it.<br>
<br>
The new Grid use a more simple approach. The Grid is made of cells. You
can configure the width and the height of cells and choose how many
cells you want horizontally and vertically. Finally you can move the
entire Grid. <br>
<br>
The movement of the Grid is not pixel based. You don't realy move the
Grid , it is more accurate to say that you apply an offset to the Grid
. Move the Grid is equalent to offset the Grid of one cell. By example
if you move the Grid up, the Grid will move of one cell up and the same
goes for the other directions.<br>
<br>
Also the color of the Grid can be changed from the Color Tab.<br>
<br>
Next time I will present the most important new feature that as been
added to the Engine : <strong>Screens and Screens Stack</strong>.
The Grid plays an important role for Screens so I needed to present it
before.<br>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Twitter
account</strong></span><br>
<br>
I opened a Twitter account some days ago, you can follow me and stay
update any time on the Engine development.<br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/nerogameengine" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter -
NeroGameEngine</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Scene
Screens</strong></span><br>
<br>
Today we are going to talk Screens. This is a new feature in the
Engine, I did not plan it for the first version, but I finally thought
it would be cool to have it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>What
is a Screen ?</strong></span><br>
<br>
First, let's begin by what most people know : <strong>Game States</strong>.
In a Game we generally have several states like : the game levels (each
level being a state), the start menu, the pause menu, the options menu
and many more. In order to manage all those states people generally
develop a Sates and States_Stack system. In this system you can switch
between States by pushing or poping them.<br>
<br>
Instead of using a State/States_Stack System, the Nero Game Engine will
use two differents systems. the <strong>Screen System</strong>
and the <strong>World Chunk System</strong>. Those two
systems combined will offer more power than a simple State System.<br>
<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>Screens :</strong></li>
</ul>
Screens are displayed on top of the Game world. They can be used to
build game menu but they can also be used as a UI Panel (window) in a
menu.<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>World Chunk :</strong></li>
</ul>
A World Chunk is a part of the Game World that can be load or destroy
dynamically (during the game). Therefore One World chunk can represent
a game level, but also, One game level can have any number of World
chunks. The ability to load and destroy World Chunks dynamically will
allows to build very large level. <strong>World Chuncks will be
added in the second version of Engine</strong>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Add,
Delete and Rename Screens</strong></span><br>
<br>
On the top left of the Engine Interface, just after the Utility_Tab, we
now have the Screen_Tab. From this tab, we can see all the available
Screens, add new Screens, delete Screens or rename Screens.<br>
<br>
Each Scene always has at least one Screen, you can delete any Screens
but once it left only one Screen, the delete button will have no effect.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e3/b1/82/e3b182922f1ff4675fd5dc4e9bf13dc5.png" alt="" class="bbc_img"><img style="width: 215px; height: 245px;" alt="" src="e3b182922f1ff4675fd5dc4e9bf13dc5.png"><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>World
View and Screen View</strong></span><br>
<br>
By default the Engine start in the <strong>World View</strong>.
In order to access Screens we need to switch to the <strong>Screen
View</strong>. On the right of the Engine Interface there is a <strong>button
called Screen View</strong>. It's a toggle button, when the
button is activated we goes in Screen View, when it's desactivated we
come back to the World View.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c0/a9/03/c0a90317b60b9c77d6f0c1e2ebcf4025.png" alt="" class="bbc_img"><img style="width: 218px; height: 85px;" alt="" src="c0a90317b60b9c77d6f0c1e2ebcf4025.png"><br>
<br>
The current View mode is also displayed on the bottom right of the
canvas.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/65/c6/7765c6b4b32713065406f565cda6b8ba.png" alt="" class="bbc_img"><img style="width: 233px; height: 80px;" alt="" src="7765c6b4b32713065406f565cda6b8ba.png"><br>
<br>
Just below the <strong>Screen View button</strong> there
is a list that allows to select a Screen.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/1e/60/48/1e60487f881e891b08a04c1ebc5b0848.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img"><img style="width: 217px; height: 189px;" alt="" src="1e60487f881e891b08a04c1ebc5b0848.jpg"><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Build
Screens</strong></span><br>
<br>
When a Screen is selected we can start building it. Each Screen has its
own Canvas color, its own Grid, its own Camera, its own layers.
Basically everything you do when a Screen is selected will affect only
that Screen. Each Screen maintains its own Undos and Redos<br>
<br>
Not all types of Objects can be added to a Screen. <strong>There
is no Physics in a Screen</strong>, Therefore it's not possible
to add Mesh_Objects, Meshed_Objects (Sprite with Mesh) and
Animation_Meshed_Objects (Animation with Mesh) In Screens.<br>
<br>
We can only add Sprite_Objects, Animation_Objects, Text_Objects and
Button_Objects.<br>
<br>
Button_Object is a new type of Object that can be add on Screens but
not in the Game World, I will present it in my next post.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Screen
and Grid</strong></span><br>
<br>
In my last post, I said that the Grid was important for Screens, it's
time to know why. Screens are rendered on top of the Game World and
they are not affected by the Camera movement. Therefore in order to be
visible a <strong>Screen must be contained in a strict area</strong>.
Since the Canvas is infinite it's become easy to be lost. This is were
the Grid comes, if you plan to render your game in a 800 x 600
resolution or a 1024 x 800 resolution, you will have to configure a
Grid of the same resolution with an offset of (0, 0). The Grid will
represent the Screen area and everything in the Grid will be displayed.<br>
<br>
That's all for this post, there is more on Screens but that will be for
the next post. The video shows the different Screens I built for the
Adventure Scene.<br>

<div class="inner" id="msg_166200">Hi everyone!
Hope you are doing great.&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley" class="smiley"><br>
<br>
In this post I will present more stuffs concerning Screens, and review
the state of the project.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Screens
and Render Engine</strong></span><br>
<br>
While the DevEngine Interface allows to build Screens, the DevEngine is
not able to render those Screens. Screens will be rendered only when
the Scene is run within the RenderEngine. The reason for that is simply
because the Screens are built arround a specific resolution. If you
build a Screen with a resolution of 1028 x 800 by example, the Screen
will not fit in the DevEngine Canvas. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Push
and Drop Screens</strong></span><br>
<br>
The first thing to do when we want to use some Screens is to push them
on the <strong>Screen_Stack</strong>. The methods <strong>pushScreen(screen_name)</strong>
and <strong>dropScreen(screen_name)</strong> are there to
manage the Screen_Stack. The only purpose of the Screen_Stack and those
methods is to provide a way to order the rendering of the Screens. Also
this allows to use only the Screens you need. You can create 10 Screens
from the DevEngine but only push and use 3 of them.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Show
and Hide Screens</strong></span><br>
<br>
Push a Screen into the Screen_Stack will not make the Screen visible.
Pushing is just a way to order the Screen. Any Screen on the
Screen_Stack can be make visible or hidden with the methods <strong>showScreen(screen_name)</strong>
and <strong>hideScreen(screen_name)</strong>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Hide
and Show the Game World</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Screens are rendered on top of the Game World, but if you want to
show a Screen but not the World like for a Game Main Menu, it's
possible to hide and show the Game World with the methods <strong>hideWorld()</strong>
and <strong>showWorld()</strong>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Find
Objects in a Screen</strong></span><br>
<br>
There are two methods to find Objects in a Screen<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>The method <strong>findScreenObject(screen_name,
object_name)</strong> will retrieve any Object that is not a
UIObject (Sprite, Animation, Text).</li>
<li>The method <strong>findScreenUIObject(screen_name,
ui_object_name)</strong> will retrieve only UIObjects (Button);</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Button
Object</strong></span><br>
<br>
In addition to the <strong>Screen System</strong> the
Engine now has a little <strong>UI Management System</strong>.
On each Screen it's possible to add some <strong>nero::UIObject</strong>.
Currently the only available UIObject is the ButtonObject. <br>
<br>
In order to add a ButtonObject just hold the <strong>Shift Key
and click on a Sprite_Button</strong>. In the DevEngine a Button
is simply a Sprite, so you can apply any Sprite transformations on it.<br>
<br>
In the future it will be possible to create ButtonObject from Animation
and Text. And there will be more UIObject like TooggleButton, CheckBox
etc.<br>
<br>
A ButtonObject offers three callBacks.<br>
<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">button<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 64);">-</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 128);">&gt;</span>setOnMouseEnter<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">[</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">]</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">{</span> &nbsp; a

I updated the Adventure Scene with some Screens. In the following video
you can see the Custom Loading Screen of the Scene, and its different
Menus. We are now close to the Engine First Version, but the most
important thing remains to be done : Build an actual game.<br>
<br>
Now that I have the skeleton of the Adventure Scene set up, It's time
to comes up with a Game Play. I think it will be the coolest part of
the project&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" class="smiley">.<br>

<div class="inner" id="msg_166337"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Engine
Update</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone, how do you do. <br>
Last week I was about to continue working on the Adventure Scene, but
something stoped me. I felt that the Engine was missing some key
features. So I went to add some features that wasn't in the schedule.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Scene Renderer</strong></span><br>
<br>
It is now possible to see the final result of your game without leaving
the DevEngine. The Engine now has a feature call the <strong>Scene
Renderer</strong>. The Renderer simulates the behavior of the <strong>RenderEngine</strong>
from within the DevEngine.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>How
to start the Renderer ?</strong></span><br>
Above the Canvas, along with the buttons Play, Pause etc, there is now
a button called <strong>Render</strong>. Click on this
button will launch the Scene Renderer.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 9pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Window
resolution</strong></span><br>
From your <strong>nero::Scene</strong> you can now set the
resolution of your game with the method below. This resolution
indicates the size of the Window used by the Scene Renderer.<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">setResolution<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 221);">1024</span>.<span style="color: rgb(0, 119, 136);">f</span>, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 221);">600</span>.<span style="color: rgb(0, 119, 136);">f</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">;</span></div>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIPp3p59t4Q?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Color Picker</strong></span><br>
<br>
The last week I tried ImGUI for the first time, and I was like :
ooooooooooooh, waaaaah !!!, this is too too powerfull !!. So I quickly
start to learn how it works and decided to integrate its Color Picker
in the Engine.<br>
<br>
Yeah, now there is a Color Picker&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" class="smiley"> . By
default the Color Picker is Hidden, but when you go to the <strong>Color_Tab</strong>
it appears automatically.<br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ofQpwYAZlnY?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>CodeBlocks
Integration</strong></span><br>
<br>
Since the Engine uses CodeBlocks, I thought it would be great if
CodeBlocks could generate a sample project for the Engine. So I went to
learn the CodeBlocks scripting API, and I created a script that
generates a Nero Game Project. Just for info Codeblocks calls that a
Wizard, and it uses the Squirrel scripting language.<br>
<br>
In the video below you can see the Nero Game Project Wizard in action.
There are three types of samples you can generate. The coolest one is
called <strong>Full Project</strong>. When you choose
that, you can indicate a Namespace, some Class Names and CodeBlocks
will create a complet project to start with.<br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gvjSmse6y5U?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Release
of Version 0.9.0</strong></span><br>
<br>
In two or three weeks I will release a new version of the SDK, it will
contains all the updates since the last one (version 0.7.1). The
Adventure Scene will be included as an example.<br>
<br>
That's all for this post. I think it will be my last post for 2018. So
see you in 2019. Have a good day&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley" class="smiley"></div>

Game Engine 0.9.0 Released</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi ! everyone. How do you do. I'm happy to announce the release of
the&nbsp; Engine SDK version 0.9.0<br>
<br>
You can download it from the website <a href="http://nero-games.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.nero-games.com</a><br>
<br>
I tried to upload it several times, my internet connection failed me.
But it succeed in the end&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley">.<br>
<br>
The Website is still in construction I will work on it on the upcomming
weeks and months<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Test
Scene : The Adventure Scene</strong></span><br>
<br>
In the package there is&nbsp; a Project called <strong>Adventure
Scene</strong> you can use it as a reference. It's a simple game
where you have to collect some coins and some stars.<br>
If you've already tried the version 0.7.1 there are many changes. I
have commented the code, so it should be easy to understand what is
going on.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Tutorials</strong></span><br>
<br>
In the upcomming weeks I will write some new tutorials. I will upload
them on the website in a structured manner.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Nero
Game Engine version 1.0</strong></span><br>
<br>
The version 1.0 is comming soon. There are basically three things to be
done before to reach that release<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1- Add some game related features (camera
shaking, bullet firing and maybe more)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;2- Build a complet game that will serve as a Demo<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3- Run a complet test of the Engine.
Track bugs and solve everything that can besolved<br>
<br>
That's all, hope you'll enjoy the new SDK. Have a good day&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt=":D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley"><br>

<div class="inner" id="msg_166911"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Engine
Update </strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone, how do you do ! here is an Engine update&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley" class="smiley">.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Bug
fix 1 : Duplicate collisions</strong></span><br>
<br>
If you've tried the Adventure Scene, you might have encountered a bug
when collecting coins. Some coins can be collected more than once.
That's because when a Physic_Object is removed by the Object_Manager,
the Physic_Object is not destroyed directly, instead it is marked as
dead and removed only when the Engine thinks the time is right. Now
there is a control that prevent dead objects to generate a collision.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Bug
fix 2 : Crash at Scene Renderer exit</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Scene Renderer crashes sometime when you exit it. This was due to
the way resources are shared between the DevEngine and the Renderer.
Now the resources shared as been reduced to the strict minimum and the
Renderer will run on its own thread.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Bug
fix 3 : Player flickering in Scene Renderer</strong></span><br>
<br>
There was a kind of flickering on the player when it moves in the Scene
Renderer. It seems the Engine has some trouble rendering the DevEngine
and the Renderer at the same time. Now when the Renderer is launched
the DevEngine will stop its rendering (only a gray screen will be
visible). The DevEngine rendering will come back automatically when the
Renderer is closed. With that change the Scene Renderer now performs
with the same quality as the nero::RenderEngine.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Download
the Update.</strong></span><br>
<br>
You can download the update with the link below. The download contains
a folder named Library. Just copy this folder into your current SDK
folder and replace all files. The files that will be replaced are the
following<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library/lib/libnero.dll.a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library/bin/libnero.dll<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library/include/Nero/[all files]<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Bug
fix : Physic Objects Center of Mass</strong></span><br>
<br>
In the current version of the Engine, Physic Objects (Box2D bodies)
don't have their center of mass at the right place. The bug exists
since the early versions of the Engine. I did not bother to solve it
until now. It's a good thing to have this bug solved because now it's
more easy to play with Box2D Joints.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Physic

<br>
With the center of mass bug fixed, it's now possible to retrieve the
size and the bounds (AABB) of a Physic Object.<br>

11 Joint Types have been integrated in the Engine API<br>
<br>
<strong>01- Distance Joint<br>
02- Friction Joint<br>
03- Gear Joint<br>
04- Motor Joint<br>
05- Mouse Joint<br>
06- Prismatic Joint<br>
07- Pulley Joint<br>
08- Revolute Joint<br>
09- Rope Joint<br>
10- Weld Joint<br>
11- Wheel Joint</strong><br>
<br>
Create Joints is pretty easy. For each Joint you have a <strong>JointProperty</strong>
object that describes the Joint parameters. The code below shows how to
create a Distance Joint between two Objects.<br>

The Engine first version is now released. The SDK can be downloaded on
the <a href="https://www.nero-games.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engine
Website</a>. It was fun to develop the Engine. There are many
features that was planned that did not make their way into the first
version, But there are also other that was not planned that endup in
the first version. I guess&nbsp; it's how projects work&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley" class="smiley"> <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Website
&amp; Tutorials</strong></span><br>
<br>
From now on, I will focus on building the Website, I plan to do some
videos tutorial and maybe write some articles on game development.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Nero
Game Engine 2.0</strong></span><br>
<br>
Developing the Engine was pretty cool, so I plan to continue with a
second version more powerfull. The second version will focus on three
things<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1- Cross platform with focus on Androind,
IOS and Nintendo Switch (or its successor);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2- Introduction of Lua as scripting
lauguage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3- A more powerfull Editor and more
features in a Scene<br>

The Update can be donwloaded from the <a href="https://www.nero-games.com/download" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website
download Page</a><br>
<br>
The installation is pretty easy. Just copy the content of the Update
Folder into The Engine SDK Folder and choose yes when asked to
overwrite the files.<br>
<br>
<strong>**Important</strong> : The Update contains a file
called <strong>Release</strong>. This file describes all
the changes, please read this file before to install the Update.<br>
<br>
<strong>This update is mainly a bug fix</strong><br>
<br>
When you render a Scene from the Dev_Engine using the <strong>[Render_Button]</strong>
on top of the Canvas, a new Window opens up with a certain size. This
size is specified in your Scene with the code below<br>
<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">void</span> MyScene<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">:</span>init<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><br>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Nero
Game Engine 2 : Engine Update </strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone, how do you do ? Today I am happy to announce that I
started working on a regular basis on the Nero Game Engine 2. In this
first update post, I will present the scope of the project and some new
features.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Project</strong></span><br>
<br>
The objective of the project is to build a Professional 2D Game Engine
based on SFML. The first release of this new Game Engine will provide
the possibility to deploy your Games on Windows, Android, and Steam.
The Engine will try to consume all the SFML API and go further. It's a
pretty big project, but things will be done one step at a time, little
by little. As you already know, a major difference with the first Nero
Game Engine will be the new Interface.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1247px; height: 732px;" alt="" src="58bcf96d9fd9b9ecb4c3fccd25ffbfef.png"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/58/bc/f9/58bcf96d9fd9b9ecb4c3fccd25ffbfef.png" alt="" class="bbc_img resized" style="cursor: pointer;" width="740"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>A
New Approach to C++ Project</strong></span><br>
<br>
Unlike the first version of the Engine, the Nero Game Engine 2 will be
available as an Editor like Unreal Engine or Unity. On Windows, you
will just have to download and install the Engine like any other
software. With this Engine you will be able to choose between three
types of projects depending on your skill with each language : C++ only
Project, Lua only Project, and C++ &amp; Lua Project. <br>
<br>
Here is a question : How do you build your game in C++ if the Engine
comes as an Editor? The answer : Shared Library.<br>
<br>
With the New Engine, It is now possible to create and compile your C++
Project from the Engine Editor as Unreal Engine does. Each C++ Project
is compiled as a Shared Library that is then loaded at runtime.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Choose
your Code Editor</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Engine does not have an built-in Code Editor, so you will need an
external one. The Engine will support two Editor at launch. Qt Creator
and Visual Studio<br>
Right now the Engine is being developed with Qt Creator, so it will be
the default Code Editor. The External Code Editor you choose will be
seamlessly integrated into the Engine. That means you will be able to
open the Code Editor from the Engine Editor.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Let's
see the new Engine at work </strong></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Create
a C++ Project</strong></span><br>
<br>
In the video below, I launch the Engine Editor, after a nice Loading
Screen, the Engine new Interface appeared. I then proceed to create a
new Workspace called "My Workspace" on my Desktop. I will talk about
workspaces in a later post. When the workspace is ready I create a new
C++ Project (CPP Project) called "My First Project" in that workspace.
When I click on the button "Create", the Engine Generates my project
files and Compiles them. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Open
my Project</strong></span><br>
<br>
When the compilation is completed the Engine asks me if I want to open
the Project, I click on "Open Project", the Qt Creator Code Editor is
automatically launched. Since it is the first time I open the project
with Qt, it asks me to choose a Kit or Import a build.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Import
my Build</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Engine already compiled the project, so you just have to import the
build generated during the compilation. Qt creator detects
automatically the build done by the Engine, In order to import it, I
select " Imported Kit - temporary" then I select&nbsp; "Build
(my/desktop/path/My Workspace/my_first_project/Build)",&nbsp; Then
I click on configure project.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Start
coding</strong></span><br>
<br>
Like in the first version of the Engine, the base Class of your game is
the nero::Scene Class. The Engine generates a Scene class base on the
name of your project In this case "MyFirstProjectScene";<br>
I go to the render() method, I draw a simple SFML Circle and compile
the project. I can compile the project from Qt Creator or the Engine
Editor. When compiling from the Engine Editor there is a little Orange
and White box on the bottom right indicating the status of the build.
When the build is completed I reload the code.<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>What
Next?</strong></span><br>
<br>
In my next post, I will talk about Workspaces and Project directory
Structure. Also, I will present the Engine new Resource Browser and
Resource Manager features. until then have a good day.<br>

Game Engine 2 : Engine Update</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone, how do you do?&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley"> I have
been working on the Engine over the last couple of weeks, I made a lot
of progress.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Coding
with Visual Studio</strong></span><br>
<br>
Visual Studio is now integrated into the Engine, When you create a new
Project, you can choose between Visual Studio and Qt creator for the
Code Editor. You can compile the code from Visual Studio or the Engine
Editor seamlessly.<br>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Playing
with the new Canvas</strong></span><br>
<br>
I begin transferring the features of the Nero Game Engine 1 to the new
Engine and it works perfectly. <br>
<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjc6VaoEsLc?fs=1&amp;start=" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="385" width="640"></iframe><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Designing
the new Scene API</strong></span><br>
<br>
I am currently designing the new Scene API, with the Nero Game Engine
2, I introduce the notion of <strong>Game Level</strong>, <strong>World
Chunk</strong>, and <strong>Scene Factory</strong>. <br>
To put things simply, a Game is made of a unique <strong>Game
World</strong> that is divided into Game Levels, each Game Level
will be divided into several World Chunks. World chunks are small parts
of the World that can be loaded or unloaded during <strong>Play
Time</strong>. <br>
The <strong>Scene Factory</strong> will be a new feature
that allows you to create Game Objects at Play Time. Those Game Objects
can then be spawned into the World.<br>
<br>
The main challenge with this new API will be on Resource Management.
When World chunks are loaded or unloaded the Engine will have to
automatically load or unload resources from memory. I am currently
thinking of a way to keep track of used and unused resources.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>That's
all</strong></span><br>
There are more new features to present, but that will be for another
post. have a good day <br>
<br>
<br>
I plan to diversify the game genres the Engine is able to handle. What
I have in mind is<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>Platformer </strong>: action,
shooting, adventure</li>
<li><strong>Top Down </strong>: RPG, Scroller</li>
<li><strong>Fighting Game</strong> : like Street
Fighter</li>
<li><strong>Card and Board Games</strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
I have been playing with <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>
and <strong>Unity</strong> lately, I took ideas from them
and begin designing a new game development API for the Engine. the new
API will make the Engine flexible on the type of game it can handle.<br>
<br>
For now I'm focusing more on the Engine core, I believe if I get it
right, adding more genre-specific features in the future will be pretty
easy.<br>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Playing

<br>
I have integrated <strong>Let There Be Light</strong> into
the Engine. For now, it is a partial integration. It's possible to add <strong>Point
Lights</strong> into the Game World and <strong>Static
Physic Objects</strong> can block light;<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>CPU
Profiling</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Engine now has a CPU Profiler integrated, the one I've chosen is
Easy Profiler(<a href="https://github.com/yse/easy_profiler" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/yse/easy_profiler</a>).
It is very simple to use and can become very useful if you decide to
build a pretty large Game.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

The next release of the Engine will be the <strong>Nero Game
Engine 2 </strong>. It will be available somewhere during this
next summer. Up until now, I was mostly experimenting with new features
for the Engine. The code is currently a big mess&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/shocked.gif" alt=":o" title="Shocked" class="smiley"> <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/shocked.gif" alt=":o" title="Shocked" class="smiley">. Now
that I feel I know what am doing, I have decided on the new features
that will be on the next release. The release will focus on the <strong>Engine
new Interface</strong>,&nbsp; a <strong>New Scene API</strong>,
and the <strong>Deployment of Games on Android</strong>. I
had planned some features like Lua Scpriting, Shaders, Particle System,
but that will be for the version 1.2.0.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Back
to the Website</strong></span><br>
<br>
Now that I am confident with the development of the New Engine, It is
time to return to work on the <strong>Engine Website</strong>
(<a href="https://nero-games.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://nero-games.com</a>).
I will continue the tutorial for the <strong>Nero Game Engine 1</strong>
and maybe write some random articles on game programming. <br>
<br>
<br>
Hi everyone! how to you do&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley"> <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley"> <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley"><br>
<br>
I have been busy the last couple of months, but I manage to get some
time and progress with the Engine<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Release
of a Demo Version on May</span></strong><br>
<br>
I will release a reduced version of the New Engine around mid-may, Many
features currently in development will be disabled for the demo. The
core features of the New Engine Editor will be available&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley" class="smiley">, you
will able to create projects and code in raw SFML. I will give more

<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Nero
Game Engine 2 : Engine Update</span></strong><br>
<br>
Now let's do a regular update&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" class="smiley"><br>
<br>
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Introducing
the POCO library</span></strong><br>
<br>
I have been looking for a <strong>Network Library</strong>
for a while now. I came across <a href="https://pocoproject.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POCO</a> recently and I was
amazed by the features it provides. It's a pretty huge library like <a href="https://www.boost.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boost</a>.
I integrated it into the Engine.<br>
<br>
Also, the Engine now use <strong>C++17 Experimental</strong>.
All the Boost libraries that need to be compiled as been removed.<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Download
Files with the Engine</span></strong><br>
<br>
Thanks to POCO you can now download files with the Engine. I begin
building a Network Module for the Engine. The most interesting Class
for now is the <strong>nero::DownloadManager</strong>. It
provides two features. <br>
The first feature is to retrieve the size of a file on the internet
using a HTTPS request.<br>
The second feature is to download a file on the internet and monitor
the download progression.<br>

&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">A
New Logging API</span></strong><br>
<br>
With the introduction of POCO, I removed the <a href="https://github.com/amrayn/easyloggingpp" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easyloggingpp
Library</a>. The Logger offered by POCO is more flexible and
adapted for the Engine needs.<br>
<br>
As a user of the Engine, nothing changes for you, the macros <strong>nero_log</strong>
and <strong>nero_log_if</strong> are still available and
work the same.<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Background
Task Management</span></strong><br>
<br>
The New Engine will be using a lot of threads to perform tasks in the
background. The Engine now offers a new class called <strong>nero::BackgroundTaskManager</strong>
or simply <strong>nero::BTManager</strong>. The class is
used like that <strong>nero::BTManager::startTask(callable,
task_name, task_category)</strong>, The callable can be a
function pointer, a lambda or a class method.<br>

There are many other features in development, I will talk more about
that during the summer. Here is what the Editor currently looks like.
There is now a nice Toolbar, a Menu Bar, the Logging work perfectly. As
with the <strong>Nero Game Engine 1</strong>, you have the

Hi everyone ! how do you do&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt=":D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley">, I am
happy to announce the release of the Engine Demo version
2.0.1&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" class="smiley"><br>
<br>
The Engine is provided with a <strong>BSD Licence</strong><br>
<br>
You can download it here : <a href="https://nero-games.com/download" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://nero-games.com/download</a><br>
<br>
It's my first time releasing an installable software, if you find any
problem please let me known.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
Configuration Wizard</strong></span><br>
<br>
When the Engine starts, it checks that everything is ok before you can
use it. When something is not ok the <strong>Configuration Wizard</strong>
will help to configure it.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 901px; height: 501px;" alt="" src="6a31829789b0f59dcd98719ba888b0cc.png"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6a/31/82/6a31829789b0f59dcd98719ba888b0cc.png" alt="" class="bbc_img resized" style="cursor: pointer;" width="740"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Configure
a Code Editor</strong></span><br>
<br>
You can choose between Qt Creator or Visual Studio 2019<br>
<br>
Visual Studio 2017 will not work, only the latest versions of Visual
Studio 2019 are compatible.<br>
<br>
You can download Qt offline with the link provided by the wizard or
search "qt online installer" on the internet.<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Configure
a Workspace</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Engine needs at least one Workspace. If you already have one you
can import it, if not, you need to create one.<br>
<br>
All inputs are checked against a regex and need to match a certain
pattern. For example, the namespace should only have 2 to 10 characters
and only use letters <strong>(regex = ^[a-zA-Z]{2,10})</strong>.
I will explain everything in detail later. <br>
<br>
Here is an example of input<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>Location : use the browse button and select your Desktop</li>
<li>Workspace Name : My Workspace</li>
<li>Company Name : Nero Games</li>
<li>Project Lead : team-lead</li>
<li>Project Namespace : ng</li>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Nero
Game Engine 1 SDK Update </strong></span><br>
<br>
I've just released a new version of the <strong>Nero Game Engine
1 SDK (r1.0.3)</strong>. With this new update, you can now change
the DevEngine Window size as you want.<br>
<br>
The DevEngine has two constructors now<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;DevEngine<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">const</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">unsigned</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">int</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 64);">&amp;</span>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">unsigned</span>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">int</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 64);">&amp;</span>

windowWidth<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">)</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">;</span></div>
<br>
With the first one, you specify the width and the height you want, with
the second one you only specify the width and the engine will compute
the height.<br>
<br>
<strong>Important</strong><br>
There are a <strong>min-width (1305.f)</strong> and a <strong>min-height(670.f)</strong>.
If you set a value below these ones, the engine will ignore your inputs.<br>
<br>
<strong>Example</strong><br>

<strong>How to update</strong><br>
You can download the full SDK already updated (Nero Game
Engine&nbsp; SDK 1.0.3) or you can download the update only (Engine
Update 1.0.3) and copy its content in your current installation <br>
<br>
<a href="https://nero-games.com/download/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download
page here</a><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>What
next</strong></span><br>
<br>
<strong>Build the website and make tutorials</strong><br>
As of now, I will focus on building the Engine Website and making some
youtube tutorials. I'll try to make 2 or 3 tutorials per week.<br>
<br>
<strong>Engine development</strong><br>
I will slow down with the Engine 2 development in order to focus on
tutorials. But just for info, the next thing I'll be working on is the
Engine Android Backend. Like Unreal on Unity, the Engine will able to
deploy your games on android automatically. <br>

Joints Tutorial</strong></span><br>
<br>
I have created a project where I experiment with all Joints. There are
11 Joints in total, So far I have implemented 8 Joints, 3 left to go<br>
<br>
You can find the project on GitHub : <a href="https://github.com/NeroGames/enginev1-physicjoint" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/NeroGames/enginev1-physicjoint</a><br>
The project shows how to build a car with wheel-joints, how to build an
elevator with prismatic-joint and many more<br>

Game Engine SDK v1.0.6 Released</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone ! How do you do ?&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley"> Happy
new year&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley"> <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley"><br>
<br>
The Engine SDK v1.0.6 has been released, you can <a href="https://nero-games.com/download/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>download
it here</strong></span></a>. I made a few bugs fixes
and some improvement<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Here
are the major changes</strong></span><br>
<br>
<strong>1- No more Default_Scene</strong><br>
The Engine/Editor will not create a Default Scene if you add at least
one Scene<br>
<br>
<strong>2- nero::Editor alias</strong><br>
The nero::DevEngine can now be referred as nero::Editor by including
the header <strong>&lt;Nero/engine/Editor.h&gt;</strong>.
It's just an alias, both classes are exactly the same.<br>
<div class="cpp geshi" style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 0);">#include
&lt;Nero/engine/Editor.h&gt;</span><br>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">}</span></div>
<br>
<strong>3- Linking Glew in the SDK</strong><br>
The SDK now comes with Glew autommtically linked. This allows you to
create OpenGL projects without any configuration. If you want to learn
OpenGL you can use the Engine SDK to do so.<br>
<br>
<strong>4- New Info Tab</strong><br>
On the Editor left, along with the tabs Sprite, Animation, etc. there
is a new tab called Info that shows the transform of a selected Object<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.pinimg.com/originals/f2/8e/b5/f28eb5ed42f4b754862a4cfceb3a5832.png?epik=dj0yJnU9LXBrZk5kNlp3X2VwSEM1WEJaQTFOSUxtYzFPdTkxdXQmcD0wJm49alctODA1dnFFLTBDVHNDRzFKaDN5USZ0PUFBQUFBR0FWd0E0" alt="" class="bbc_img"><br>
<br>
<strong>5- Bug : Engine modes and Screen View</strong><br>
In Screen View, switching between the Editor modes (Object, Mesh, Play)
was making the Editor crash. To fix that, I added the following rules<br>
- <strong>Rule 1 </strong>: Activating the Screen View
(pressing on Screen_View Button) is only possible when the Editor is in
Object Mode.<br>
- <strong>Rule 2</strong> : When in Screen View it becomes
impossible to change the Editor Mode. Pressing the Spacebar will have
no effect. Checking the Checkboxes will be impossible (nothing happens
if pressed&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title="Tongue" class="smiley">)<br>

a Multiplayer Game Server for the Engine</strong></span><br>
<br>
Yes, it's decided, the Nero Game Engine 2 will support online
multiplayer games at launch <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" class="smiley">. I've
spent the last couple of weeks doing researches on how to create
multiplayer games. I found this GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/MFatihMAR/Game-Networking-Resources" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/MFatihMAR/Game-Networking-Resources</a>,
super awesome, it contains many articles on how popular games like Doom
and Quake multiplayer work. I also discovered Glenn Fiedler, a guy who
worked on multiple video game network modules (like God of War ). His
website <a href="https://gafferongames.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gafferongames.com/</a>
has lots of cool articles and he has also created his own multiplayer
library called Yojimbo.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>The
difficult part</strong></span><br>
<br>
Since the Engine uses Box2D for physics, the most difficult issue will
be to sync all clients with the server so they can have the same exact
physic simulation. In a series of articles, <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/introduction_to_networked_physics/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gafferongames.com/post/introduction_to_networked_physics/</a>
Glenn Fiedler presents three techniques.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>Deterministic Lockstep</li>
<li>Snapshot Interpolation (with Linear or Hermite
Interpolation and Snapshot Compression)</li>
<li>State Synchronization</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>What
I decided for now</strong></span><br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li><strong>Architecture</strong>: client/server
with authoritative or semi-authoritative server</li>
<li><strong>Number of players</strong>: 4 players.
(MMORPG won't be for now, but you never know&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt=":D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley">) </li>
<li><strong>Sync Technique</strong>: State
Synchronization</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Choosing
a library</strong></span><br>
<br>
I found multiple C++ libraries specialized in multiplayer gaming, the
three that attract me the most are the following in order of
preference. I will evaluate them and choose one.<br>
<ul class="bbc_list" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><strong>GameNetworkingSockets</strong> from
Valve</li>
<li><strong>Yojimbo</strong> from&nbsp; Glenn
Fiedler</li>
<li><strong>ENet</strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>If
any of you has experience with multiplayer programming let me know any
advice is welcome&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt=":D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley"></strong></span>

Update</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi, how do you do <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley" class="smiley">, the
summer is here, I'm back working on the engine regularly.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Latest
Progess</strong></span><br>
<br>
Below you can see an overview of the Engine Editor Architecture. I'm
currently working on the following : <strong>Level Builder</strong>,
<strong>Screen Builder</strong> and <strong>Startup
Screen Builder</strong>. The goal is to transfer and improve the
features of the Engine v1 to the new engine and make a release in about
two months. <br>
<br>
I work directly on GitHub now, the latest code is on the branch <a href="https://github.com/NeroGames/Nero-Game-Engine/tree/engine/v2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">engine/v2</a>.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 978px; height: 598px;" alt="" src="8739199be2e5b5328e65e059f1644515.jpg"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/39/19/8739199be2e5b5328e65e059f1644515.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img resized" style="cursor: pointer;" width="700"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Coding
Level</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Engine will offer three (3) levels of coding. <br>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>The first level is your Scene class (like in the Engine
first version).</li>
<li>The second level is your <strong>Levels </strong>and
<strong>Screens </strong>classes. Each time you create
a new level or screen a new class will be created</li>
<li>The third level is a <strong>Game Script</strong>.
A game script can be created and attached to any object like a
component. Several Game scripts can be added to the same Game Object</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>What's
next</strong></span><br>

In my next post, I'll present in detail the Engine Game Level and Game
Level Builder features. Have a good day.<br>

Game Engine v2 Update : Game Levels (Part 1)</strong></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Create
Game level</strong></span><br>
<br>
It is now possible to create <strong>Game Levels</strong>
with the Engine. On the top right of the Canvas, there is a button "<strong>New
Level</strong>", when you click on it a popup will open up and
let you create a new level. The <strong>Level View</strong>
at the button shows you the list of existing levels.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1920px; height: 1040px;" alt="" src="create_game_level.png"><img src="https://nero-games.com/resource/artwork/sfml_forum/26june2021/create_game_level.png" alt="" class="bbc_img resized" style="cursor: pointer;" width="700"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Game
Level Directory</strong></span><br>
<br>
When a new level is created, a new directory is also created under "<strong>Project
Folder/Scene/level/level_name</strong>". The directory contains
all the data relative to the level : game assets, settings, etc.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://nero-games.com/resource/artwork/sfml_forum/26june2021/level_directory.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img"><br>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Game
Level Class</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Engine generates automatically a new class for each level under <strong>"Project

next</span></strong><br>
<br>
In my next post we'll talk about managing Game Level assets and World
Chunks<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;" class="bbc_size">Nero
Game Engine v2 Update : Game Levels (part 2)</span></strong><br>
<br>
Hi everyone!, how do you do&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley" class="smiley"><br>
<br>
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size">Managing
Game Levels</span></strong><br>
<br>
The Engine Editor loads one Game Level at a time, which means it is
possible to <strong>"Open"</strong> and <strong>"Close"</strong>
a Level. <br>
<br>
When a Level is opened, it will appear in full orange background in the
Level List view (image below, the second level <strong>"Gate of
Fate"</strong> is the one currently opened). Also, the name of
the opened Level appears on the bottom left of the canvas.<br>
<br>
You can open and close levels manually with the buttons on top of the
Levels list view. First, you have to select the level you want by
simply clicking on it. Selected Levels have an Orange border. (image
below, the third Level <strong>"End Gate"</strong> is
currently selected).<br>
<br>

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size">Game
Level Resources</span></strong><br>
<br>
Once a Game Level is opened you can access its resources (sprites,
fonts, etc). Each Level manages its own resources. The <strong>Resource
Browser Tab</strong> (image below) only show the resources of the
currently opened Level<br>
<br>
Each time you import resources (sprites, fonts etc.) They get copied in
the level&nbsp; resource directory at <strong>Project-Name/Scene/level/Level-Name/resource</strong><br>
<br>

<br>
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size">What's
Next</span></strong><br>
It is time to start building Game Levels, Next time the Engine will be
able to build levels, save them and restore them when the Editor
restart.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Nero
Game Engine v2 Update : Game Levels (part 3)</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone! How do you do&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley">?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Building
the Game World</strong></span><br>
<br>
It's now possible to add objects into Game Levels and build your Game
World. Saving and Loading Levels work fine&nbsp; <img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/forums/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" class="smiley"><br>
The video below shows the full process from creating a new project,
adding game levels, and editing the game world<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>What's
next</strong></span><br>
<br>
I'll continue transferring all the features of the First Engine and
work on the Editor Interface (Explorer, Edit object properties, etc.)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Current
RoadMap</strong></span><br>
<br>
In order to reach the next release, I'll have to complete the following
features<br>
<br>
<ul class="bbc_list" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Building
the Game World</strong></span> : Implement all the features
of the First Engine regarding the creation of Game World (mostly a lot
of work on the Editor Interface)</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Playing
the Game </strong></span>: Make Game Levels playable
inside the Editor in real-time like with the First Engine</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Releasing
the Game</strong></span> : Make the Editor generate your
final game package with one click </li>
</ul>

Game Engine v2 Update : Explorer View</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hi everyone how do you do ?<br>
<br>
The development of the Engine is progressing very well, I had to
rewrite the Mesh Class, took me more time than expected&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Scene
Graph</strong></span><br>
<br>
At the top of the Explorer view, you now have the Scenegraph. You can
use it to browse through all the objects inside the current level.<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Game
Object Properties</strong></span><br>
<br>
At the bottom of the Explorer view, you can edit the properties of the
selected object. I'm still working on this one&nbsp; <br>
